Weber (1922) found that isolates from wheat, rye and Poa pratensis were cross-inoculable on all of these three hosts, but not on species from eight other genera tested which included Agropyron and Hordeum. There is evidence for the existence of separate strains in eastern and western Canada; in the USA, biotypes could be distinguished using differential wheat hosts (Sutton and Waterston, 1966).Different results were obtained with isolates from Triticum on Hordeum (Holmes and Colhoun, 1970; Shearer and Zadoks, 1972; Smedegard-Petersen, 1974; Martin and Cooke, 1979; Cunfer and Youmans, 1983).Cross-infection tests with isolates from Triticum and Hordeum have suggested the existence of wheat- and barley-adapted types that are sometimes considered as distinct biotypes (Cunfer and Youmans, 1983) or formae speciales (Smedegard-Petersen, 1974). Other reports were made: because cultural characters could be changed by passaging isolates through the host that they were not 'adapted to', this casts doubt on the existence of two distinct types of P. nodorum (Holmes and Colhoun, 1970).Isolates of P. nodorum were obtained from Bromus inermis, Elytrigia repens [Elymus repens], Aegilops cylindrica, Cynodon dactylon, Hordeum pusillum, Lolium perenne, which are found naturally infected and thus considered as alternative hosts (Khokhar and Pacumba, 1987). Ao and Griffiths (1976) inoculated various plants with spore suspensions: Agropyron repens [Elymus repens], Agrostis tenuis [A. capillaris], Avena fatua, Avena ludoviciana [Avena sterilis subsp. ludoviciana], Bromus mollis [B. hordeaceus], Bromus sterilis, Festuca arundinacea, Holcus lanatus, Hordeum vulgare (four cultivars), Lolium multiflorum, Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, Poa annua, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis. Pycnidia were produced and P. nodorum was re-isolated from all hosts studied; isolate virulence was observed on wheat.Khokhar and Pacumba (1985, 1987) observed that Lolium perenne and Cynodon dactylon can act as alternative hosts in the USA. The same observations were made by Krupinsky (1986a, 1986b) with Bromus inermis.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Host-Plant Resistance Resistance to P. nodorum has been studied. Techniques used to quantify resistance include different criteria: incubation period, latent period, area under disease progress curve. Different levels of resistance are observed among varieties: this partial resistance is polygenic.Frecha (1973) reported a single dominant gene for resistance in winter wheat: the gene was located by Kleijer et al. (1977). Monogenic control of resistance in seedlings was also reported by Wong and Hughes (1989). However, many other studies indicate that resistance is polygenically controlled (Nelson, 1980; Nelson and Gates, 1982; Karjalainen, 1983).   Chemical Control Seed treatmentAlthough there is no clear indication of the importance of seed contamination on the development of the disease, seed treatments are used. A number of compounds have been showed to be effective against seedborne P. nodorum: carboxin + thiram, guazatine triacetate, maneb, oxine-copper and thiram.Foliar spraysThe use of fungicide sprays to control P. nodorum has been investigated for many years. In recent years, however, economic and environmental constraints have led to the need for a reduction of the fungicide input in wheat. The association between disease progression and weather patterns has been used to optimize timing of sprays.Few reports on fungicide activity against 'septoria diseases' provide clear evidence for separate activity against P. nodorum and M. graminicola.Carbamates, such as carbendazim and maneb, have been found effective. Among the morpholines, tridemorph, and among imidazoles, prochloraz are used.Among the more recently developed fungicides, many triazoles (e.g. bromuconazole, cyproconazole, fenbuconazole, flusilazole) are reported to have activity and are used in the field.   Cultural Control Ploughing in infected stubble after harvest can help to diminish the severity of infection. \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Introduction On rice, control measures will be the same as those described for C. suppressalis (Walker), with particular emphasis on IPM. The relative importance of different lepidopterous stem borer species attacking rice will influence decisions on control, which must be based on local conditions. Control measures include: cultural control (flooding, harrowing and ploughing to minimize population carryover; destroying volunteer rice plants; regulating planting times; using early-maturing varieties; synchronizing planting; and removing stems at harvest), biological control (through conservation and enhancement of natural enemies), use of host-plant resistance and pheromonal control to disrupt mating. Chemical control is generally considered unsuitable.Chaudhary and Sharma (1986) have summarized control measures used against C. auricilius on sugarcane in India.   Cultural Control On sugarcane, healthy setts should be selected for planting or, if this is not possible, infested setts should be planted in furrows under a 5-7 cm layer of soil to prevent the emergence of adults. Harvest residues and stubbles should be destroyed to prevent carryover from one crop to another and applications of fertilizers should be restricted to recommended doses, as heavy applications, especially of nitrogenous fertilizers, favour build-up of stem borer populations.Singh et al. (1997) found that the incidence of C. auricilius was markedly higher in autumn and spring planted crops than in the late spring planted crop which had a negligible incidence.   Host-Plant Resistance Plant breeding for host-plant resistance against sugarcane and rice stem borers is in progress in most countries where these crops are grown. Madan et al. (1981) reviewed varietal resistance in sugarcane against stem borers and noted that genotypes that are comparatively resistant include Co 1007, Co 1236, Co 7302, Co 7303, S-5/75, S-38/76, E 92 and E 168. Kanwar and Srivastava (1999) in Indian Punjab tested the varieties CoJ64, CoJ83, CoS8436, CoS88230, CoJ82 and CoJ84. Varieties CoJ83, CoS88230 and CoS8436 were most susceptible to the borer.   Biological Control Classical biological control of C. auricilius by the introduction of exotic agents has been attempted on a number of occasions on sugarcane in India and Java; biological control by conservation, augmentation and release of indigenous natural enemies has also been attempted.In India, Chaudhary and Sharma (1986) reported that trials with Trichogramma spp. and with the exotic tachinid Lixophaga diatraeae had failed to give effective control of C. auricilius. Of the indigenous parasitoids, the tachinid Sturmiopsis inferens and the braconid Pycnobracon mutator may parasitize more than 50% of larvae; mass-rearing techniques were being developed to augment natural populations. Varma et al. (1991) reported that the inundative release of Trichogramma chilonis on sugarcane in India reduced C. auricilius infestation from 61 to 12.6% in treated areas. Brar et al. (1996) also found it successful in Punjab. Varma and Nigam (1989) reported the successful establishment of the exotic braconid parasitoid, Allorhogas pyralophagus, at two locations in India.In Java, Samoedi (1989) reported that mass releases of Diatraeophaga striatalis effectively controlled C. auricilius on sugarcane.Work on rice in India to assess the effectiveness of 14 indigenous and exotic egg, larval and pupal parasitoids indicated that strains of Trichogramma japonicum from India or the Philippines and a native Telenomus sp. were the most effective egg parasitoids; the exotic nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae showed promise as a larval parasitoid and the native Tetrastichus ayyari was an effective pupal parasitoid (Rao and Rao, 1980).   Chemical Control Various chemical control measures against C. auricilius and other sugarcane stem borers have been devised, including soil applications of granular systemics and foliar sprays of a wide range of insecticides. Spraying mature sugarcane crops is now considered to be neither feasible nor effective and non-chemical control measures are favoured. Some chemical controls, such as soaking setts in insecticide for a few hours before planting, may be useful in some circumstances.Bacillus thuringiensis formulations were tested in the laboratory by Shenhmar and Varma (1997).The same applies to this species on rice.   Pheromonal Control Studies on mating disruption by release of artificial pheromones indicate that this may be a feasible method of controlling C. auricilius. Campion et al. (1987) reported the results of small-scale trials of mating disruption with pheromones in India.   Integrated Pest Management On rice and sugarcane, control of C. auricilius will usually be incidental to IPM of the major pest species of Chilo (C. suppressalis and C. sacchariphagus, respectively). For sugarcane in India, Chaudhary and Sharma (1986) have suggested an IPM approach based on a list of eleven elements, including one chemical and ten non-chemical methods. On sugarcane in China, a programme of control was described by Liu et al. (1996).   Phytosanitary Measures  In the past, the main spread of stem borers within and between countries and continents was probably in infested planting material, especially sugarcane setts. Further spread is now limited by phytosanitary regulations controlling the transfer of such material. \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control   Delayed colonization of the crop reduces the time available for second and subsequent generations to develop (Voss et al., 1988). Delayed colonization could be achieved by various means, such as crop rotation, manipulation by planting date, setting up different barriers (such as plastic line trenches, portable trench barriers, mulching), and mechanical collection of beetles on overwintering sites or immediately after colonization.  Crop rotation delays colonization of the crop by overwintered adults and reduces the size of the population that subsequently develops within the crop. Population reductions of 90% or more have been reported in potato (Lashomb and Ng, 1984; Wright, 1984). The effect of crop rotation is increased with increased distance from the source of overwintering beetles. Follett et al. (1996) suggested 0.5 km as the minimum distance necessary to fully benefit from field rotation. Because rotated potato fields require fewer insecticides to control L. decemlineata (Speese and Sterrett, 1998), crop rotation is an important tool in delaying the development of resistance to insecticides (Roush et al., 1990). Saxon and Wyman (2005), in their suggestion of developing of an area-wide L. decemlineata pest management strategy, reported that long-distance rotations of more than 400 m were an effective cultural control management strategy to limit adult beetle infestations in the spring. This strategy can be optimized when collaborating growers are able to maximize their rotational distances by coordinating their rotational schemes over large areas. Deploying long-distance rotations over a large area over many years would limit L. decemlineata populations and could result in a signifcantly reduced L. decemlineata populations entering fields in the spring. The planting date of a potato crop can be manipulated to reduce the population of second generation larvae produced in the crop. Early planting of short season varieties allows the crop to mature before the second larval generation is produced. In contrast, colonization of late planted, rotated potato plantings occurs later in the season causing most summer generation adults to emerge after the critical photoperiod for diapause induction has been reached. Consequently, these adults do not produce a second generation of larvae (Weber and Ferro, 1993). Plastic-lined trenches, which serve as pitfall traps, and trap crops of early-planted potato have both been shown to effectively intercept overwintered adults in the spring, before they colonize the potato crop. Plastic-lined trenches that were V-shaped with an average width at the top of 740\\u00b17 mm and depth of 223\\u00b12 mm retained 95% of the beetles they trapped in controlled field experiments (Misener et al., 1993; Boiteau and Osborn, 1999). Because 50-75% of overwintered beetles disperse into a nearby potato crop by walking, properly designed trenches, positioned to intercept the dispersing beetles can provide a significant level of crop protection. At one location in New York, USA, more than 100,000 overwintered beetles were trapped in 91 m of trench (Moyer, 1993).  Overwintering beetles are frequently found in windbreaks and hedgerows adjacent to the crop at densities of hundreds per square metre, whereas densities within the fields average only 3-7 beetles per square metre (Weber and Ferro 1993, Hunt and Tan 2000). This distribution of overwintering beetles clearly has important implications for the management of L. decemlineata, particularly when another solanaceous crop is planned for the same or an adjacent field in the following year. For some growers crop rotation is not a viable option due to a shortage of land. Hunt and Vernon (2001) suggested that barriers placed along the margins of tomato and potato fields adjacent to preferred overwintering sites may be effective in preventing or slowing the entry of beetles into the crop in the spring. They designed an above-ground trench composed of an extruded, UV retarded PVC plastic trough, designed to allow L. decemlineata and other pests to enter the device and become trapped and killed inside. The above-ground trench can capture thousands of newly emerged L. decemlineata as they walk from their overwintering habitat into an adjacent crop, and also reduce crop damage. This trap is easily installed in the spring and removed in the fall, and is reusable for several years. The trench is black to raise the temperature, which results in an increase in beetle mortality, and is designed to release water and beneficial insects. Mulching potato and aubergine plantings with straw has been shown to significantly reduce L. decemlineata infestations and defoliation, reduce the number of insecticide treatments needed and increase yield (Zehnder and Hough-Goldstein, 1990; Stoner, 1993; 1997). The mulch delays colonization and increases predation on eggs and larvae (Ng and Lashomb, 1983; Brust, 1994). Lower potato beetle populations and less damage to tomato has been reported in reduced tillage plantings than in conventional tilled plantings (Hunt, 1998). Mechanical collection, use of propane flamers, use of pneumatic thermal machines or bio-collectors can prevent adult colonization and reduce larval damage (Boiteau et al., 1992; Karalus, 1994; Pelletier et al., 1995; Lague et al., 1999a, b; Derafshi, 2006). The bio-collector is a novel control method approved for use in organic potato cultivation in Germany. The collector, which is attached to a tractor, blows chrysomelids off the potato plants and collects them in trays. Collections are made two to three times per year depending on the level of infestation (Karalus, 1994). However, some authors stated that mechanical control causes undesirable damage and its efficacy should be improved (Sablon et al., 2013).  Although Boiteau et al. (2012) found in laboratory trials that wood ash is toxic to adult and larval stages of the L. decemlineata, the significant control observed in the laboratory did not extend to field application.  Semiochemical-based strategies  The chemical ecology of L. decemlineata is not yet completely understood and this incomplete knowledge makes semiochemical-based approaches inefficient when compared to traditional insecticide treatments (Sablon et al., 2013). According to Sablon et al. (2013a). Nevertheless, alternative strategies have potential to control L. decemlineata populations and include: (1) disorientation of L. decemlineata adults by masking potato volatile organic compounds (VOC) with intercropping cultures; (2) use of synthetic mixtures of volatiles and/or aggregation pheromone to trap beetles; (3) antifeedant sprays on potatoes; (4) increase, with genetic manipulations, the natural capacity of the plant to recognize the presence of L. decemlineata through chemical signals, thereby triggering defence mechanisms.  (1) Intercropping or companion planting may represent an efficient method to repel and/or confuse L. decemlineata foraging for host plants. Matthews et al. (1982) reported that the use of tansy as an intercrop in potato fields may result with 60-100% of decrease in the number of beetles present in the fields. The initial results reported by Thierry and Visser (1986; 1987) have shown that potato VOCs mixed with VOCs from tomato or cabbage disrupted searching behaviour of L. decemlineata females for host plants. Alghali et al. (2000) reported that L. decemlineata larvae were more frequently encountered in the pure potato plots compared with the potato/cabbage intercropped crops (either alternate rows of potato and cabbage or alternate row strips of potato and cabbage). Moreau et al. (2006) tested bush beans (Phaseolus vilgaris cv. Provider), flax (cv. Natasia), French marigold (Tagetes patula cv. Bolero), horseradish and tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) as companion plants to potatoes. In addition, some botanical and microbiological preparations (capsicain extract, garlic extract, neem extract, Bt product, adjuvant and pine extract) were evaluated. The results showed that companion planting and garlic and capsicain extracts did not reduce the densities of L. decemlineata on potatoes.  (2) The basic strategy of trap crops is aimed to attract L. decemlineata in a specific part of the field where potato plants are planted earlier or where potato plants are treated with semiochemicals. The next step is to treat only this part of field to eliminate attracted beetles.  In a small plot study in Massachusetts, USA, the colonization of potato fields by adults that overwintered in wooded borders of potato fields was reduced by about 60% when beetles in the trap crop were collected daily or killed with an insecticide (Weber et al., 1994). Trap crops have been shown to reduce L. decemlineata infestations and increase yields in tomato by 61-87% (Hunt and Whitfield, 1996).  L. decemlineata as a chewing insect is very sensitive to VOCs released by host plants, because the damage they induce in plant tissues increases the release of these compounds (Szendrei and Rodriguez Saona, 2010). Dickens (2000) investigated in laboratory trials behavioural responses of the L. decemlineata to volatiles emitted from solanaceous host plants, non-host legume plants and 13 synthetic blends of three individual chemicals emitted by potato plants. He found that L. decemlineata is attracted to blends of specific chemicals emitted by their host plants. In further investigations, Dickens (2002) reported a synthetic blend of three compounds ((Z)-3 hexenyl actetate. \\u00b1-linalool and methyl salicylate) which attracted second and fourth larval instars. This blend attracted newly emerged and 5-day-old adults in greenhouse trials (Martel et al., 2005a), and initial field tests confirmed the effect of the attractant blend and its usefulness for semiochemical-based control (Martel et al., 2005b). Pitfall traps baited with the attractant captured a greater number of L. decemlineata in potato fields. Moreover, fewer egg masses and larvae were observed in neighbouring untreated crops. The use of trap crops with the attractive blend allowed for a 44% pesticide reduction for similar yields compared to conventional methods (Martel et al., 2005b). In another study (Martel et al., 2007), this blend was coupled with pyrethroid insecticide at different concentrations. The use of this attracticide showed the same control efficiency as the commercial insecticide whilst using 92% less insecticide. Since many L. decemlineata populations have developed the resistance to permethrin, the authors suggested imidacloprid as a replacement.  A male-produced aggregation pheromone for L. decemlineata was identified as (S)-3, 7-dimethyl-2-oxo-oct-6-ene-1, 3-diol [(S)- L. decemlineata I] by Dickens et al. (2002). The pheromone has been shown to be attractive to L. decemlineata larvae (Hammock et al., 2007) as well as male and female adults (Dickens et al., 2002). Kuhar et al. (2006) demonstrated the attractiveness of (S)- L. decemlineata I in the field as well as its potential for integrated pest management of L. decemlineata. However, the synthetic routes for (S)- L. decemlineata I of high purity have been complicated and expensive. Therefore Kuhar et al. (2012) conducted pitfall trap studies to assess the relative attraction of L. decemlineata\\u00a0adults to synthetic mixtures of the (S) and (R) enentiomers of the pheromone. The results indicated that any further research as well as IPM strategies that incorporate L. decemlineata I as an aggregation pheromone should utilize blends containing more than 87% optical purity of the (S)-enentiomer of the pheromone. The main difficulty with semiochemicals is ensuring a controlled release during a long period (Sablon et al., 2013). The choice of dispenser is very important to control the release and to prevent molecule degradation (Heuskin et al., 2011).  (3) The basic concept of the use of antifeedants is to spray them on potatoes to deter L. decemlineata feeding and reduce damage of potato foliage. Many of antifeedants are constituent of plants from sagebrush community, hydroxides which also act as fungicides, alchocol extracts of the leaves and bark of Quercus alba L., limonin, sesquiterpenes (Sablon et al., 2013), \\u03b1-mangostin (Kim and Lan, 2011), terpenoid lactones (Szczepanik et al., 2005) and extracts from various plants (Gokce et al., 2006a, Pavela et al., 2004, 2009) including potatoes (Szafranek et al., 2008). Neem extract, a well-recognized botanical insecticide, also shows antifeeding activity against L. decemlineata, but the magnitude of the effects depends on the dominant L. decemlineata life stage present when application was made and on attack intensity (Zehnder and Warthen, 1988; Bezjak et al., 2006; Igrc Barcic et al., 2006). Such molecules and blends of chemicals not only reduce feeding but also may deter oviposition by females as shown for saponins (Waligora-Rosada 2010) and citrus limonoids (Murray et al., 1995). Very often antifeedants are considered as synthetic insecticides whereas they originate from plants and should therefore be considered as botanical insecticides. According to Sablon et al. (2013a) this is one of the reasons why the commercialization of antifeedants has been generally unsuccessful.  Biological Control   Edovum puttleri has been released in several areas in the eastern USA and is being investigated for possible release in Europe (Schauff, 1991). Research on E. puttleri in relation to its potential for biological control of the Colorado potato beetle in the USA is reviewed by Schroder and Athanas (1989a, b) and Schroder et al. (1985). The ability of augmentative releases of E. puttleri to control Colorado potato beetle was assessed on aubergine in New Jersey, USA (Lashomb et al., 1987) and Italy (Pucci and Dominici, 1988) and on potato in Maryland, USA (Schroder and Athanas, 1989a, b) and Ontario and New Brunswick, Canada (Sears and Boiteau, 1989). The most favourable results were obtained for aubergine in New Jersey (Lashomb et al., 1987) and for potato in Maryland (Schroder et al., 1985; Schroder and Athanas, 1989a, b). However, detailed comparisons between these studies were limited by the variation in numbers of wasps released and the methods used to evaluate the impact on the host populations (Van Driesche et al., 1991). Results reported by Van Driesche et al. (1991) for augmentative releases of E. puttleri against L. decemlineata on potatoes in Massachusetts, USA, confirmed the findings of Sears and Boiteau (1989) that releases of E. puttleri are ineffective against first-generation eggs. Parasitoid releases had greater impact on second generation eggs. The release of 47,000 wasps in 1988 against the second generation, without pesticide, resulted in 34.4% parasitism and 16.1% host feeding; a total reduction of 50.5%. Releases of Podisus maculiventris, at 76,000/ha, reduced egg numbers of Colorado potato beetle in the second and third generations in field model experiments in Moldova, Russia (Novozhilov et al., 1991). The complex of natural enemies, including 26 carabids, 11 coccinellids and three chrysopids, added to the beneficial effect of the pentatomid. When L. decemlineata eggs were exposed to P. maculiventris and twelve-spotted ladybeetle (Coleomegilla maculata), predation on L. decemlineata eggs by both predators together did not increase significantly over levels inflicted by either predator alone (Mallampalli et al., 2002). Aldrich and Cantelo (1999) demonstrated that pheromones of P. maculiventris could be used to attract females and thereby enhance populations of the predator within a potato planting. Augmentative releases of Perillus bioculatus controlled first-generation eggs and larvae of L. decemlineata in field-plot tests conducted during two seasons under short-season conditions in Quebec, Canada (Cloutier and Bauduin, 1995).  Sablon et al. (2011) reported on the results of laboratory assay in which the use of lacewing larva Chysoperla carnea allowed an efficient reduction of L. decemlineata eggs and larvae. Sablon et al. (2013b) have shown that the first and second instar of C. carnea only consumed eggs, whereas the third instar of consumed all L. decemlineata immature stages. The third instar killed four times as many L. decemlineata larvae than other larval stages. However, field assays are needed to confirm the efficiency of this natural enemy under field conditions. The nematode Pristionchus uniformis reduced populations of L. decemlineata in greenhouse and field experiments in Poland (Fedorko and Stanuszek, 1971). Variable suppression of L. decemlineata populations was achieved in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada, following application of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae (Stewart et al., 1998). Among the four investigated nematode species (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and H. megidis), Trdan et al. (2009) found the application of higher concentrations of S. feltiae to be the best for the control of overwintering adults for the purpose of preventing mass appearance. Adel and Hussein (2010) reported a significant reduction of the number of damaged leaves and lower index of damage achieved with Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora foliage application. Ebrahimi et al. (2011) investigated the effect of the sublethal concentrations of the same nematode species on L. decemlineata. They found that sublethal nematode concentrations caused wing deformation and delayed metamorphosis which may affect L. decemlineata adult fitness and have long term effect on population pressure. Most work on fungi for the biological control of chrysomelid hosts has focused on the use of Beauveria bassiana against the Colorado potato beetle. Attempts at controlling L. decemlineata with Beauveria in Russia and Eastern Europe began with large-scale research programmes in Russia that led to the mass production and relatively widespread use of Beauveria-based products, generally bearing the name 'boverin' (Ayleshina, 1978; Lipa, 1985). This Beauveria-based approach to the control of the Colorado potato beetle was most effective on low and moderate populations of the beetles. The extensive use of B. bassiana against L. decemlineata in biological control programmes in Russia during the 1970s and 1980s is summarized by Feng et al. (1994). During the mid-1980s, a pilot test programme studying the efficacy of B. bassiana for the biocontrol of Colorado potato beetle on potatoes in the USA showed mixed results, but demonstrated that, at its best, the fungus could provide foliar protection and result in yields approaching those of pesticide-treated control plots (Watt and LeBrun, 1984; Hajek et al., 1987). In America, the use of B. bassiana to control L. decemlineata never achieved either the scale or the reported success of the Soviet effort and was eventually abandoned by the commercial firm that provided the formulated fungus for the pilot test programme.  Kryukov et al. (2014) established for the first time that the peroral effect of the fungal culture of Cordyceps militaris resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in survival, and delayed developmental time and moulting, as well as increased sensitivity of larvae to the fungus Beauveria bassiana. Following the invasion of the potato-growing areas of Continental Europe, attempts were made to introduce North American natural enemies, known to be important mortality factors, to France, from 1929-1940. Two tachinids, Myiopharus doryphorae and M. aberrans; two pentatomids, Perillus bioculatus and Podisus maculiventris; and a carabid, Lebia grandis, were cultured and released, but none became established. Work resumed in 1957 under a co-operative programme involving 12 countries. Efforts concentrated on attempting to establish P. bioculatus, again without success; it was concluded that P. bioculatus was not adapted to conditions in Europe. Further introductions of M. doryphorae were also made in France but the European strain of L. decemlineata was resistant to parasitism by this tachinid (Greathead, 1976). Attempts at introducing natural enemies were then abandoned until the discovery of Endovum puttleri, which was imported into several countries and released but did not persist for long periods. Recent efforts in the Czech Republic to use Beauveria to control L. decemlineata have shown some success (Dirlbekova and Dirlbek, 1987; Dirlbek and Dirlbekova, 1987; Dirlbek, 1988; Dirlbekova et al., 1992). Effective control of L. decemlineata was achieved in potato fields in New Jersey, USA, in 1989-1990, using foliar applications of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis. The bacillus was sprayed when an average 1-30% of marked egg masses had hatched. Significantly greater defoliation, greater numbers of third- and fourth-instar larvae, and lower yields occurred in plots when the initial application was delayed until 6 days after 30% egg hatch, compared with plots treated at 30% egg hatch (Ghidiu and Zehnder, 1993). When applied properly, foliar applications of commercial formulations of B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis provided effective control of L. decemlineata and protected the potato crop from defoliation. Because B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis must be ingested to be effective, is most effective against small larvae, and has only limited residual activity once applied to foliage, proper timing of applications and thorough spray coverage of the crop are critical to effective control (Zehnder and Gelernter, 1989; Ferro and Lyon, 1991; Zehnder et al., 1992; Dubois and Jossi, 1993; Korol' et al., 1994; Ferro, 2000). Ghassemi-Kahrizeh and Aramideh (2014) have proven in laboratory assays that there is a remarkable synergistic effect of Henna powder on Bacillus thuringiensis efficiency.  In organic agriculture pest management, the mainstay for insect control, including L. decemlineata control, has been pyrethrum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. This has a knock-down effect, but a short residual activity (Zehnder et al., 2007). Piperonil butoxide (PBO) is also used as a synergist for pyrethrins and the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides. Because pyrethrins are harmful to beneficial animals, such as predatory mites, parasitoids, and honey bees, the use of the synergist reduces the concentration of pyrethrins necessary for pest control. Owing to the concern over PBO, dillapiol is considered as a potential replacement. Dillapiol, which was first found in the Indian dill, Anethum sowa Roxb. ex Fleming (Apiaceae), is nearly as effective as PBO as a pyrethrin synergist (Joffe et al. 2012). In laboratory trials that pyrethrum efficacy was increased 2.2 times with the SS strain and 9.1 times with the RS strains of L. decemlineata by using pyrethrum + diallipol (Liu et al., 2014). In field trials with the pyrethrum+ diallipol formulation demonstrated efficacy \\u226510 times than pyrethrum alone.  Besides pyrethrum extracts, many plant extracts and essential oils have been tested against L. decemlineata. Among the tested plants, Humulus lupulus extract has been proven by Gokce et al. (2006b) and by Cam et al. (2012) to be toxic to L. decemlineata larvae. The essential oils of Mentha longifolia (Rafiee-Dastjerdi et al., 2014), Letharia vulpina and Peltigera rufescens (Emsen et al., 2013) and Piper nigrum (Scott et al., 2003) can also control L. decemlineata.  Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers. Several studies have shown that some of the monoterpens have potential for L. decemlineata control. Monoterpene hydrocarbons exhibited high toxicity as compared with oxygenated monoterpenes; 1,8-cineole, fenchone, \\u03b2-pinene and \\u03b3-terpinene can be used as potential control agents against both L. decemlineata larvae and adults (Kordali et al., 2007). Khorram et al. (2011) tested 6 pure monoterpene hydrocarbons as a single compounds or mixtures; all six tested compounds (monoterpene hydrocarbons) can be used as potential control agents against both larvae and adults of L. decemlineata, either as single compounds or in mixtures. Mahdi et al. (2011) tested 12 pure oxygenated monoterpenes as two different doses for their toxicity against second and third instar of larvae and adults of L. decemlineata; out of 12 tested, oxygenated monoterpenes, fenchone, linalool, citronella and menthone showed a strong toxicity against the tested developmental stages.Transgenic Plants Transgenic potatoes expressing the gene for B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis Cry3A delta -endotoxin were approved for commercial use in the USA in 1995. In 1998, transgenic potato varieties expressing the Cry3A toxin were planted on approximately 20,000 hectares in the USA. Although these transgenic potato varieties are highly toxic to Colorado potato beetle (Perlak et al., 1993; Wierenga et al., 1996) and provide excellent control of the beetle, planting of Cry3A toxin-expressing transgenic potato varieties declined dramatically by 2000 due to concern over consumer resistance to purchasing transgenic potatoes and products made from them. An additional factor contributing to this decline was competition from new, conventional insecticides that controlled a broader spectrum of potato pests. The future role of transgenic potato varieties in the Colorado potato beetle management is currently uncertain, despite their effectiveness and considerable evidence that they have no significant effect on populations of natural enemies (Hoy et al., 1998; Riddick et al., 1998). Transgenic lines of aubergine expressing the Cry3A endotoxin (Hamilton et al., 1997b) and lines expressing the Cry3B endotoxin (Arpaia et al., 1997; Mennella et al., 1998), although not commercially available, have been shown to provide control of Colorado potato beetle. Because of the potential that Colorado potato beetle will develop resistance to the Cry3A endotoxin if these transgenic potato varieties are widely planted, significant effort has been directed towards the development of resistance management strategies for transgenic potatoes. Proposed resistance management strategies for potato focus on using varieties that express a high dose of the toxin in conjunction with plantings of refuge areas of non-transgenic potato or other hosts in which beetles are not controlled. The level of toxin expressed should be high enough to kill any individuals that are heterozygous for resistance alleles. The size and location of refuge plantings must be such that any homozygous resistant beetles selected on the transgenic crop mate with homozygous susceptible beetles produced in the refuge. The progeny of such matings would be heterozygous for the resistance allele and would be killed if they fed on the transgenic crop. Strategies for managing resistance to transgenic potatoes are discussed by Gould et al. (1994) and Hoy (1999). Ochoa-Campuzano et al. (2013) identified prohibitin, an essential protein for L. decemlineata larval viability. They explored the possibility for prohiobitin-1 silencing in L. decemlineata larvae in order to reach higher efficacy of Cry3Aa toxin. Cooper et al. (2006) assessed the effectiveness of the protein avidin against the Colorado potato beetle neonates in a no-choice detached leaf bioassay at 0, 17, 34, 51, 102, and 204 \\u03bcg avidin/ml over 12 d. The combined effects of avidin (136 \\u03bcg avidin/ml) with Bt-Cry3A or leptines were evaluated with neonates and third instars over 12 and 6 days, respectively. Survival of third instars on the Bt-Cry3A with avidin was significantly reduced after 3 days compared with survival on the Bt-Cry3A, suggesting the addition of avidin may increase susceptibility to Bt-Cry3A. The Colorado potato beetle spiroplasma (CPBS) appears to be host (genus)-specific and is transmitted among larvae and adults during regurgitation and defecation. However, researchers have adopted a strategy to engineer spiroplasma with an insect-lethal gene because the spiroplasma appears to be a commensal (Hackett et al., 1988; Gasparich et al., 1993a, b). The delta-endotoxin gene for B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis (Btt) may be an appropriate gene for this purpose because the Colorado potato beetle is susceptible to the toxin and the CPBS adheres to the midgut microvilli (Hackett and Clark, 1989), which is the site of action of the delta-endotoxin. This system would allow multiplication and spread of the genetically-engineered microorganism throughout the crop in contrast to direct treatment of beetles with the Btt beta-endotoxin.RNAi interference  Zhu et al. (2011) reported the results of study in which the potential of feeding dsRNA expressed in bacteria or synthesized in vitro to manage populations of L. decemlineata was investigated. Feeding RNA interference (RNAi) successfully triggered the silencing of all five target genes tested and caused significant mortality and reduced body weight gain in the treated beetles. This study provides the first example of an effective RNAi response in insects after feeding dsRNA produced in bacteria. The obtained results suggest that the efficient induction of RNAi using bacteria to deliver dsRNA is a possible method for management of L. decemlineata. This method is still in the experimental stage.  Host-Plant Resistance   The incorporation of varietal resistance to Colorado potato beetle has emphasised the transfer of resistance traits to S. tuberosum from other Solanum species using a variety of techniques to obtain successful interspecific crosses (Shapiro et al., 1991; Tingey and Yencho, 1994). Emphasis has been placed on resistance derived from Solanum berthaultii, which is mediated in large part by glandular trichomes on the foliage (Yencho et al., 1996) and on resistance derived from Solanum chacoense, which is mediated by high concentrations of leptine glycoalkaloids in the foliage (Sinden et al., 1986; Sanford et al., 1997; Yencho et al., 2000). Potato breeding lines with resistance to potato beetle have been released (Plaisted et al., 1992; Lorenzen and Balbyshev, 1997). Other potentially valuable mechanisms of resistance have been identified as well (for example, Balbyshev and Lorenzen, 1997).Chemical Control Chemical insecticides have constituted the primary method of control for Colorado potato beetle for much of its history as a pest of potato. However, the extraordinary ability of the beetle to develop resistance to virtually all insecticides used to control it has led repeated control failures in many areas (Casagrande, 1987; Georghiou and Lagunes-Tejeda, 1991; Bishop and Grafius, 1996). The commercialisation of several new insecticides with novel modes of action, which are effective in controlling Colorado potato beetle populations resistant to organophosphate, carbamate, chlorinated hydrocarbon and pyrethroid insecticides has restored the ability to control the beetle with insecticides in areas most severely affected by resistance. In the past 60 years L. decemlineata has developed resistance to 54 different insecticides, including imidacloprid and eight other neonicotinoids (Whalon et al., 2013). Up to 155-fold resistance to imidacloprod was reported in adult L. decemlineata from selected fields on Long Island, New York state, USA, after three seasons of use (Zhao et al., 2000), followed by thiamethoxam and clothianidin in other regions of the USA (Mota-Sanchez et al., 2006; Alyokhin et al., 2007; 2008). Because of the importance of insecticides in managing Colorado potato beetle in commercial potato production, great emphasis has been placed on the development of procedures for managing resistance. Key processes involved in adaptation of Colorado potato beetle populations to insecticides have been explored using simulation models (Follett et al., 1993, 1995). Resistance management efforts for Colorado potato beetle focus primarily on using pest management procedures, including crop rotation, scouting and action thresholds to minimize the use of insecticides in conjunction with resistance monitoring and rotations of insecticides having different modes of action (Kennedy and French, 1994; Grafius, 1997; Midgarden et al., 1997; Dively et al., 1998). A computerized approach to insecticide management for the Colorado potato beetle has been used in commercial potato fields on the eastern shore of Virginia, USA (Vencill et al., 1995). The Potato-Insect Expert System (PIES) uses insect life stages, potato growth stage, percentage defoliation and other factors to determine whether the application of insecticide is necessary to prevent tuber yield loss. Recommendations from PIES were compared with commercial spray thresholds based on the number of L. decemlineata per stem. Tuber yields were not significantly different between the two methods, although on average PIES recommended fewer insecticide applications than the conventional method. Visual defoliation ratings for PIES also required less time than conventional sampling for L. decemlineata on potato stems.  In order to establish an integrated pest management system, a temperature-driven decision support system (SIMLEP DSS) was designed for Europe, consisting of two modules (Jorg et al., 2007). SIMLEP 1 is a regional forecasting model for the first occurrence of hibernating beetles and the start of egg laying. SIMLEP 3 is a field-specific model which forecasts the occurrence of the developmental stages of L. decemlineata. From 1999 to 2004 SIMLEP 3 was validated in Germany, Austria, Italy and Poland. In about 90% of cases SIMLEP 3 correctly predicted the periods of maximum egg laying and young larval occurrence, which are the optimal periods for field assessments and treatments with conventional and biological insecticides. SIMLEP 3 has since been validated in Slovenia (Kos et al., 2009). SIMLEP 3 is used in practice in Germany and Austria on a large scale and in the western part of Poland.Integrated Pest Management IPM programs for potato emphasize reducing insect pest populations by using a number of measures against the pest, including crop rotation, altered planting dates (to avoid peak pest populations), and use of B. thuringiensis toxins and other pesticides only when necessary to prevent damaging populations from developing. IPM systems seek to maximise the impact of naturally occurring biological control in suppressing potato beetle populations (Hazzard et al., 1991; Hilbeck et al., 1997, 1998). One such management system is described by Ferro (2000).  The suggestion of adding sub lethal dosages of chemical insecticides to biological insecticides in order to improve their efficacy was raised by Kovacevic (1960) and was later discussed by Benz (1971). Some investigations showed that the combinations of the subnormal dosages of some insecticides could result in the improved efficacy of B. thuringiensis insecticides and independent synergism against L. decemlineata (Dobrincic 1996; Dobrincic and Igrc Barcic, 1998). If the combinations of insecticides at lower dosages are used, various benefits could be expected (Igrc Barcic et al., 2006): (1) ecological, for lower dosage means less pollution; (2) biological, the combinations could slow up resistance development, and the joint action of the insecticides used could result in a synergistic effect; and (3) economic, as there would be lower costs per treatment. In field trials one application of a combination of reduced spinosad and B.t.t. doses, plus pyrethrin, resulted in good protection from L. decemlineata larval attack, which resulted in satisfactory protection of the leaves and in significant yield increase of potato yield. Adding the low dose of spinosad to B.t.t. insecticide in laboratory trials resulted in a low increase in efficacy of B.t.t., and adding a low dose of B.t.t. to spinosad did not result in any change of the efficacy of spinosad (Ba\\u017eok et al., 2008). No synergistic effect between the insecticides was noted; the joint actions of combinations were mainly described as independent synergism. Even with the independent synergism the combinations could be recommended for use if they had some advantages over other possibilities for the control of L. decemlineata. Considerable effort has been directed toward enhancing naturally occurring biological control through augmentative releases of predators and parasitoids. In research plots releases of nymphs of Perillus bioculatus, either alone or in combination with weekly or less frequent applications of B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis, were investigated in Delaware, USA (Hough-Goldstein and Whalen, 1993). In Quebec, Canada, inundative releases of P. bioculatus showed potential for suppressing Colorado potato beetle populations when used within an IPM programme (Cloutier and Bauduin, 1995). Releases of the parasitoid Edovum puttleri were a critical component in the management of insecticide resistant potato beetles in aubergine in New Jersey, USA. However, the programme was expensive and has been largely discontinued following the introduction of new insecticides highly effective against potato beetle populations resistant to traditional insecticides.Phytosanitary Measures Countries at risk should require that consignments of any plants or plant products be found free from L. decemlineata after having been subjected to sorting and packaging techniques in suitable premises. In addition, potatoes and certain vegetable crops should be grown in fields which have been inspected during the growing season and found to be free from the pest, and/or in areas where either the pest does not occur or is under intensive official control. \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness  Colorado beetle principally attacks an introduced field crop grown as a monoculture, but not to an extent that has affected the area of the crop grown.

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Introduction   The more weeds ecologically resemble the crop plant, the worse they are. Perhaps the worst weeds of rice are wild species of rice that shed their seeds before the crop is ripe and have seeds with dormancy (Cook, 1990). O. rufipogon infestations are difficult and expensive to control. There is no single technique that will eliminate the problem. Hand weeding is still practised, mainly in developing nations, but with hand weeding, workers are faced with the dilemma of distinguishing between weeds and the crop. The closer the weed resembles the crop, the more likely it is to be overlooked during weeding. Chemical control of O. rufipogon in rice is difficult because of the close genetic relationship between the weed and the crop. Effective control of O. rufipogon and other weedy rice species in rice depends upon a rigorous weed management programme. Integrated weed control systems, involving the use of certified seed (or good quality weed-free seed), good land preparation, the use of stale seedbeds to encourage weed germination before seeding, careful crop and water management, herbicides and crop rotation are needed. In crop rotation, rice may be rotated with other crops in alternate seasons and an appropriate herbicide can be used to destroy weedy rice seedlings in these crops. Such programmes are recommended for rice in Asia and the Americas (Grist, 1986; Smith and Hill, 1990; Ampong-Nyarko and De Datta, 1991; Moody, 1994).Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods Cleanliness of cultivation To avoid unnecessarily introducing the weed, the use of weed-free crop seed, the removal of red rice seed from irrigation water i.e. control of red rice growth in irrigation ditches, and the use of clean cultivation equipment are recommended. Wrigley (1969) commented on the difficulty of separating seeds of O. rufipogon from rice seeds by winnowing. Weeds and off-types of rice that synchronously flower and mature with the cultivated variety should be hand rogued to reduce crop seed contamination. Crop rotation with control of red rice in all crops Crop rotation is a very effective method of controlling difficult weeds in rice. Rice should be rotated with other grain or legume crops such as sorghum or soyabean. During the years in which the alternate crop is grown, cultivation and herbicide treatments should be used to control red rice thoroughly, and provide a clean bed in which to sow rice in the third or fourth year of the rotation. When the alternate crop is grown, pre-plant soil incorporating herbicides such as metolachlor, either alone or tank mixed with trifluralin, pendimethalin, metribuzin or imazaquin, may be used. Post-emergence treatments include the use of fluazifop, quizalofop or sethoxydim, or directed sprays of paraquat to control red rice missed by pre-plant treatments. Crop and water management Transplanting rice has multiple benefits; germination of the weed should be considerably reduced, and those that do germinate can still be removed by weeding. Even if the weeds are not removed they will be much less competitive and produce less seed than they would in a direct-sown crop. Trebuil et al. (1983) reported that rice is transplanted when the sown field has a high incidence of wild rice. It has become increasingly difficult to combat wild rice over the years as its morphological characteristic become closer to those of cultivated varieties because of strong selection pressuredue to long and careful weeding and possible natural hybridization with cultivated varieties. The following practices are also effective: plant spacing, where crop competition can be used to reduce weed growth; high seedling rate of cultivated rice to reduce tillering of wild rice; and burning straw after harvest to kill wild rice seeds. O. rufipogon seeds that are buried will not germinate in flooded or water-saturated soil, but under these conditions the plants will propagate by stem cuttings or stem bases. Continuous flooding reduces perennial wild red rice seed survival and attracts ducks that feed on the grains. Seeds do not survive ingestion by waterfowl (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2001). In Khulna, Bangladesh, an early flowering deepwater rice cultivar Ashina is cultivated when the rice field becomes badly infested with Jhora-dan. Since Ashina flowers 2-3 weeks earlier than Johra-dan, weeding of Johra-dan can be easily done after harvesting Ashina (Morishima et al., 1991).Salimath (1921) recommended rotating different rice cultivars with different coloured stems. He recommended growing the white-stemmed cultivar Mugad for 2 years and weeding out all the red-stemmed plants and then in the succeeding 2 years growing the red-stemmed cv. Antarsali and weeding out all the white-stemmed plants. Roy (1921) recommended the use of purple-leaved cultivars, and land preparation (stale seedbed and puddling) for the control of red rice. For effective control of wild rice, Thakur (1969) recommended the growing of BR 11 or BR 12, which are purple cultivars. Srivastava et al. (1987) recommend the use of certified seed, regular removal pre- and post-flowering and cultivation of purple-leaved cultivars continuously for 2 or 3 years for the control of wild rice. The rice seedlings are, therefore, easy to distinguish from the green wild rice seedlings. O. rufipogon is not a weed problem in California, USA, because of a seed certification programme. Certified rice seed is used by practically all the farmers in the state and O. rufipogon is not permitted in certified seed. In the 10 years before 1932, 28% of California rice seed samples had O. rufipogon present at an average of 95 seeds/kg, the highest count being 1060/kg (Bellue, 1932).Mechanical Cultivation It is recommended that rice is sown in rows so that wild rice can be recognized by its presence between the rows and can be removed by hand or cultivation. Early ploughing of land after harvest to encourage the germination of O. rufipogon and control of these emergent weeds by grazing cattle, cultivation with spike tooth harrow or herbicide application are effective. Early ploughing after harvest followed by flooding in the first 3 weeks aids control of the weed. Early season cultivation and harrowing stimulate germination of O. rufipogon and may allow the mechanical destruction of several flushes of wild rice growth before rice or rotational crops are planted.Chemical Control In the rice crop, infestations are reduced by applying molinate pre-plant incorporated (Smith and Khodayari, 1985), water seeding the rice, and maintaining the flood water, or keeping the soil moist by frequent irrigation, for several weeks after seeding. According to Hyakutake et al. (1990), O. rufipogon from Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Brazil was tolerant to thiobencarb, while that from India, Myanmar and Guyana was susceptible. All were susceptible to simetryn regardless of origin. Thiobencarb can also be surface applied, pre-planting, just before bringing on the flood (Smith and Khodayari, 1985). Although thiobencarb has been recommended for use on O. rufipogon in rice, it is recommended that the crop seed be treated with a protectant or antidote, such as NA (1,8-naphthalic anhydride), as a safeguard (Wirjarhardja and Susilo, 1979; Smith and Hill, 1990). Chemicals are more commonly used pre-sowing to destroy the rice weed before the susceptible crop is present, for example, chemicals such as metolachlor either alone or tank mixed with trifluralin, pendimethalin, metribuzin or imazaquin are pre-sowing treatments recommended by Smith and Hill (1990). Chen (2001) also obtained effective control of O. rufipogon by applying atrazine or atrazine + metolachlor in maize or grain sorghum grown in rotation with rice. The method of weed control chosen will depend upon the cropping system and the benefit to cost ratio. Recommendations for control of O. rufipogon in the developing world are detailed in Moody (1994) and those for the Americas are reviewed by Smith and Hill (1990). Chen (2001) used the following steps to obtain 96% control of O. rufipogon. 1. A seedbed was finely prepared by disking and tine harrowing about 1 month before sowing. 2. This was irrigated two to three times to keep the surface soil moist for 25-30 days to stimulate germination of wild rice seeds. 3. When the wild rice seedlings reached the 3-4 leaf stage (95% of seeds in the 0-4 cm soil layer had germinated), a mixture of paraquat and oxadiazon was applied. 4. Rice seeds were direct seeded to a depth of 1-2 cm by drilling under zero-tillage to avoid turning up of wild rice seeds from the deeper soil layers. 5. The field was irrigated after sowing to promote germination of rice seeds. 6. The field was flooded from the 3.5 leaf stage of rice to check emergence of wild rice and other weeds. A new approach to chemical control of wild and red rice is the use of herbicide-tolerant crop cultivars, which can be safely treated with otherwise non-selective herbicides such as glufosinate (Sankula et al., 1997). There is, however, concern that the tolerance genes will be transferred by out-crossing to wild rice, thus eventually reducing the effectiveness of the treatment. For example, Langevin et al. (1990) reported morphological convergence between cultivated and weedy O. sativa, with hybrids demonstrated to be more vigorous than pure weeds. A genetic barrier to outcrossing should be introduced into the herbicide-resistant crop to prevent the transferring of herbicide resistance to the weed species.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control   In India, emergence and establishment of C. album is favoured by sowing in early compared to late November (North-West Asia, particularly India and Pakistan). Populations of this weed can be reduced by effective integrated management involving competitive crop varieties, crop rotation, cross-row sowing, nutrient management and cropping date. Competitive crop varieties can suppress growth of the weed by establishing early canopy cover. In crops such as wheat and barley narrow row spacing, cross row sowing and higher seed rates can further suppress the growth of individuals (Johri et al., 1992). In areas where the population density of C. album is very high, the stale seed bed technique can be used to encourage weed emergence prior to crop sowing so depleting the soil seed reservoir. Crop rotation and nutrient management can be effectively integrated with other cultural practices for the management of this weed in wheat (Balyan et al., 1988; Bhagawati et al., 1989). C. album has also been found to be sensitive to flaming (Vanhala, 1996), whilst manual weeding and earthing-up are effective in potato (Jaiswal, 1994). Manual weeding at 25, 40, 55 and 70 days after sowing significantly reduced total weed dry weight and increased wheat yield in trials conducted in Madhya Pradesh, India (Singh and Bajpai, 1992). The major goal of any sustainable cultural control programme should be to prevent the consistent enrichment of the soil seed bank.Biological Control Ascochyta caulina, a myco-herbicide, has been used for control of C. album (Horsten and Kempenaar, 1994; Kempenaar, 1995). C. album has been identified among targets for future research into the potential for biological control (Schroeder et al., 1993).Chemical Control C. album is sensitive to a range of foliage-applied herbicides, including 2,4-D, MCPA,\\u00a0paraquat, bentazone, dichlofop, isoproturon, metoxuron, methabenzthiazuron, sulfosulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl, chlorotoluron, bromoxynil and dicamba. Lorenzi (1984) and Mamarot and Rodriguez (1997) provide suggestions for use of herbicides and herbicide mixtures in a wide range of crops in Brazil and France respectively. Lorenzi indicates resistance to asulam and only moderate susceptibility to acifluorfen,\\u00a0butachlor and metolachlor in Brazil. Isoproturon alone, isoproturon + dicamba or 2,4-D + isoproturon + surfactant provided the maximum control of C. album in wheat (Malik et al., 1992). C. album control in soybean (Glycine max) was greater with thifensulfuron (Monks et al., 1993). Tank mixtures of bentazone and imazethapyr controlled both redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) and C. album in Phaseolus vulgaris. Biotypes of this weed, resistant to atrazine, chloridazon and pyridate have been reported (Solymosi and Lehoczki, 1989; Parks et al., 1995). Atrazine-resistant biotypes have been a particular problem in maize, but a combination of reduced herbicide application rates and mechanical cultivation have provided effective alternative control strategies for both triazine-resistant and susceptible C. album biotypes (Parks et al., 1995). \\u00a0\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness  C. album seems to grow most vigorously in temperate and subtemperate regions, but it is also a potentially serious weed in almost all winter-sown crops of the tropics and subtropics.
