      "### Possible Diagnoses\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Leafminers (Liriomyza spp.)**:\n",
      "   - **Symptoms**: Leafminer adults are small black and yellow flies. They lay eggs that hatch into larvae, which feed by mining between the upper and lower layers of the leaves, creating tunnels. This can result in holes and white spotting or stippling on the leaves.\n",
      "   - **Management**: Use yellow sticky traps to catch adults, conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps, and practice crop rotation. Chemical control options include Abamectin, Bifenthrin, Cyromazine, and Methoxyfenozide.\n",
      "   - **Source**: \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Maize Leafhopper (Cicadulina mbila)**:\n",
      "   - **Symptoms**: While the feeding activities of C. mbila produce negligible direct damage, they transmit Maize streak virus (MSV), which causes pale spots that coalesce into chlorotic streaks. Severe infections can lead to stunted growth and small cobs.\n",
      "   - **Management**: Plant maize away from previously infested areas, use systemic insecticides, and consider MSV-resistant maize varieties.\n",
      "   - **Source**: \n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "Please provide additional details about the symptoms to refine the diagnosis. If the symptoms match one of the above diagnoses, you can follow the recommended management practices. If not, further information will help identify the exact issue.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Dosage Recommendations**:\n",
      "- **Fenitrothion**: Apply at a low dose rate suitable for ULV spraying. The exact dosage should be confirmed with local agricultural extension services or product labels.\n",
      "- **Cypermethrin**: Similarly, apply at a low dose rate suitable for ULV spraying. Confirm the exact dosage with local guidelines or product labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Application Frequency**:\n",
      "- Rapid response is essential. Apply the insecticide as soon as larvae are detected, especially when they turn black at the III-IV instar moult.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Special Considerations**:\n",
      "- Ensure compliance with local regulations and product labels.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Prevention**:\n",
      "   - **Crop Rotation**: Practice crop rotation with non-host plants such as maize, sorghum, or millet to disrupt the life cycle of the pest.\n",
      "   - **Sanitation**: Remove plant debris to prevent it from becoming a reservoir for the pest.\n",
      "   - **Mulching**: Apply mulch on the ground to prevent pupae from reaching the soil for further development.\n",
      "   - **Hedge Rows**: Conserve natural enemies by providing hedge rows of flowering plants around the farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Biocontrol Recommendations**:\n",
      "   - **Natural Predators**: Conserve natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and ladybird beetles.\n",
      "   - **Biopesticides**: Use neem-based biopesticides (e.g., Neemark EC, Neemaj Super-3000, and Neemroc EC) at the recommended rates to control the pest.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Chemical Recommendations**:\n",
      "   - **Abamectin**: Spray abamectin (e.g., Abalone 18EC, Agrimec 18EC) at the recommended rates. It has translaminar properties with limited systemic activity and contact and stomach action. IRAC 6.\n",
      "   - **Bifenthrin**: Spray bifenthrin at a rate of 5ml in 20 liters of water. It is non-systemic with contact and stomach action. Pyrethroid; IRAC 3A.\n",
      "   - **Imidacloprid**: Drench with imidacloprid at the recommended rates. It is a systemic insecticide with translaminar activity and contact and stomach action. Neonicotinoid, IRAC 4A.\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Precautions**:\n",
      "   - Always wear protective clothing when applying pesticides.\n",

      "Bots Response: When using glyphosate on your crops in Kenya, it is crucial to follow safety precautions to protect yourself, others, and the environment. Here are some general guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n",
      "- **Clothing**: Wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers that cover your legs. Ensure the trousers are pulled over the outside of your boots.\n",
      "- **Gloves**: Use gloves made of nitrile, rubber, or neoprene. They should reach the elbows and fit comfortably.\n",
      "- **Boots**: Wear waterproof rubber boots. Avoid leather boots as they can absorb pesticides.\n",
      "- **Eye Protection**: Use glasses or a face shield to protect your eyes.\n",
      "- **Face Mask**: Use a face mask to cover your mouth and nose.\n",
      "- **Apron**: Use an apron, especially in wet conditions, to protect your clothing from becoming wet.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling and Application\n",
      "- **Wind Conditions**: Do not work in strong winds. Ensure any wind blows the pesticide away from you.\n",
      "- **Spraying**: Avoid spraying into orchard margins, watercourses, and wildlife areas. Maintain a constant speed and do not spray while the vehicle is turning.\n",
      "- **Clogged Nozzles**: Never suck or blow out clogged nozzles or pipe connections by mouth. Clean them with water and a soft stick or nylon bristle brush.\n",
      "- **Hygiene**: Wash your hands and face thoroughly after using pesticides and before engaging in any other activity. Never eat, drink, or smoke when handling pesticides or in recently treated areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Storage and Disposal\n",
      "- **Storage**: Store pesticides in a locked box or cabinet outside the house and away from where animals live. Ensure the storage area is cool, shaded, and well-ventilated.\n",
      "- **Disposal**: Dispose of excess pesticides and containers according to local regulations to avoid environmental contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Environmental Precautions\n",
      "- **Sensitive Areas**: Avoid spraying near houses, schools, playgrounds, hospitals, bee hives, lakes, streams, pastures, or sensitive crops. If necessary, spray downwind from these areas and notify residents and beekeepers in advance.\n",
      "- **Drift and Run-off**: Choose weather conditions, pesticides, application equipment, pressure, droplet size, formulations, and adjuvants that minimize drift and run-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Legal and Safety Compliance\n",
      "- **Pre-notification**: Inform all persons in the intended treatment areas or adjacent areas about pesticide applications before they are applied.\n",
      "- **Label Instructions**: Always read and follow the label recommendations for dosage, timing, and application methods.\n",
