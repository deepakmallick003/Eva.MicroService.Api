Cultural Control  Flooding the field to submerge rice for 2 days is an effective control strategy for rice thrips (Reissig et al., 1986; Pathak and Khan, 1994).Host-Plant ResistanceIn the Philippines, a method was developed to evaluate rice cultivars for resistance to rice thrips in the greenhouse (Nugaliyadde and Heinrichs, 1984b). Resistance was shown by Dahanala 2220, BJ 1, and the following wild rice species: Oryza officinalis, O. eichingeri, O. punctata and O. minuta.In India, the following rice varieties are found resistant to S. biformis: Ptb 33, BG379-1 and Kalubalawee Sudurvi 305 (Velusamy et al. 1981); IET 8200, IET 8258 and IET 8283 (Jaswant et al., 1983); B441B126-3-2-1 and BG367-7 (Dhaliwal et al., 1984); IET9705, IET9709, IET9719, IET9711, IET9727, IET9725, IET9723, IET9720, and IET9710 (Rajendran, 1986); TM4506 (Logiswaran et al., 1987); AS13744, RAU4071-57-13 and RP2430-103-56-51 (Subramanian and Velusamy, 1987).Of the 800 varieties studied in Sri Lanka, Dahanala 2220, Dahanala 682 and Kaluheenati 547 showed resistance (Kudagamage, 1977).Thayumanawan et al. (1990) found that resistant varieties have significantly higher contents of total phenols, chlorgenic and gallic acids, making them unacceptable to rice thrips.Chemical ControlAlthough S. biformis is a minor pest of rice, several workers from India, China, Korea, and Bangladesh have investigated the use of different insecticides against this pest.In India, chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, and leptophos were effective as root-dip treatments in newly transplanted rice (Mohanasundaran et al., 1978). Quinalphos, phosalone and carbaryl as sprays afforded control (Barwal and Rao, 1983). Neem oil was found to be as effective as\\u00a0fenthion in controlling S. biformis (Pillai and Ponniah, 1988).In China, thiocyclam and hydrogen oxalate, a preparation developed from an annelid worm, was effective when applied as a spray or a root-zone treatment against thrips (Shang and Chiu, 1981; Chiu, 1985).\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods  Callan (1941) and Fennah (1947) recommended cultural control based on the larval requirement of damp soil for pupation. If feasible, tomato crops should be planted to flower during the dry season and the soil at the base of the plants should be kept as dry as possible to increase larval mortality in the soil. This can be achieved by watering into trenches dug between rows of plants or through sections of bamboo placed vertically in the soil near each plant.   Chemical Control Chemical controls may be effective against ovipositing adults and/or larvae in the soil but no published recommendations seem to have been made since Callan (1941) and Fennah (1947). Spraying the youngest flower buds with a contact insecticide will kill ovipositing females when they are active and application of an insecticidal dust to the surface of the soil beneath plants will kill larvae as they enter the ground to pupate. \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.  It is very difficult to eradicate TYRV in regions where it has infected crops because of its wide host range and efficient vectors. As with all viruses, once the pathogen has entered the plant, it is practically impossible to break the host-pathogen relationship or even just reduce disease development (Pappu et al., 2009; Riley et al., 2011). Tactics employed in TYRV management must be based on thorough understanding of epidemiological principles and must fall within Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approaches that include biological, chemical, cultural, host-plant resistance and physical control (Culbreath et al., 2003). Biological control relies on the use of natural enemies like the predatory mites (Neoseiulus cucumeris, Stratiolaelaps miles [Stratiolaelaps scimitus] and Gaeolaelaps aculeifer), minute pirate bug (Orius insidiosus), entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernema feltiae) and entomopathogenic fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae) to control the thrips vectors (Bennison et al., 2001; Krishnamoorthy et al., 2007; Cloyd, 2009). Biological control can be difficult to implement as synthetic pesticides and antagonists are likely to interfere with the biological control agent. There are no viricides to control TYRV and/or any other plant viruses. Thus, chemical control aims to reduce thrips vector populations so as to reduce virus spread. Systemic insecticides are most suitable as thrips like to inhabit areas that are difficult for contact insecticides to penetrate (Melzer et al., 2012). However, the vectors have a tendency to quickly develop resistance to insecticides (Kay and Herron, 2010). To counter the development of resistance, insecticides with different chemistries and modes of action must be used in an insecticide rotation system (Herron and James, 2007; Kay and Herron, 2010). Insecticide application should be done judiciously so that there are no toxic residues, insecticide resistance and destruction of biological control agents (Pappu et al., 2009). Cultural control practices are critical in managing orthotospoviruses. Old infected crops should be sprayed for thrips and removed as soon as possible, especially if young crops are to be planted nearby. This is also true for volunteer plants and weeds, especially from the Asteraceae and Solanaceae families (Cloyd, 2009; Melzer et al., 2012). Farmers should avoid overlapping sowing of susceptible crops as this tends to create a \\u2018green-bridge\\u2019 as infected thrips vectors can migrate from the old crop to the new crop and spread the virus. TYRV can be introduced to other areas via infected seedlings. Therefore, seedlings sourced from nurseries should screened for TYRV before planting or transportation to other areas. Nurseries must also be kept weed-free and systematically monitored for thrips vectors using yellow sticky traps hung vertically above plants. Some trap or lure crops like Transvaal daisy (Gerbera jamesonii) can also be grown away from the main crop. These should be periodically sprayed with an insecticide or inoculated with thrips\\u2019 biological control agents to keep the vector population down (Blumthal et al., 2005). To date, there are no commercially available TYRV-resistant varieties. However, it is possible to develop varieties that are resistant to orthotospoviruses using both conventional and genetic engineering breeding approaches (Gubba et al., 2002; Soler et al., 2003; Uhrig, 2007; Sivparsad and Gubba, 2011). The high costs and socio-political debates associated with the production of transgenic plants are impediments to the adoption of orthotospovirus-resistant varieties in some countries.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness  Tomato yellow ring orthotospovirus (TYRV) is a plant-infecting virus that was first reported in Iran as Tomato yellow fruit ring virus (TYFRV) in 2002. Prior to that, it had been wrongly identified as Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) on potato in 2000. In some literature, it is referred to as Tomato Varamin virus (ToVV). It has also been reported to be present in Kenya and Poland. In Poland, the virus was found on tomatoes in one growing season. It has not been detected in subsequent seasons. The virus has a wide host range that includes ornamental plants, weeds and important food and cash crops from the families Solanaceae and Fabaceae. It infects crops grown in open fields and protected environments. TYRV is transmitted principally by the cosmopolitan and highly polyphagous onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) in a persistent and propagative manner. In addition, it can also be transmitted via infected potato tubers and mechanically through infected plant sap. While it has a limited geographical distribution so far, the presence of its vectors and host plants in many countries across all continents necessitates continuous monitoring to prevent its introduction into new areas where it could potentially rapidly spread out of control and cause severe economic losses. In that regard, it has been designated as a pathogen of quarantine importance in Australia, while the European Union continuously screens imported plants for the virus and its vectors. Economic losses caused by TYRV have not yet been quantified, but high disease incidences were reported in soyabean and potatoes in Iran. TYRV occurs in mixed infections with other orthotospoviruses such as Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV), Iris yellow spot orthotospovirus (IYSV) and Impatiens necrotic spot orthotospovirus (INSV). This increases the chances of recombination and reassortment which could give rise to new species and/or more virulent strains of the pathogen.\"}\n",

Cultural Control  Flooding the field to submerge rice for 2 days is an effective control strategy for rice thrips (Reissig et al., 1986; Pathak and Khan, 1994).Host-Plant ResistanceIn the Philippines, a method was developed to evaluate rice cultivars for resistance to rice thrips in the greenhouse (Nugaliyadde and Heinrichs, 1984b). Resistance was shown by Dahanala 2220, BJ 1, and the following wild rice species: Oryza officinalis, O. eichingeri, O. punctata and O. minuta.In India, the following rice varieties are found resistant to S. biformis: Ptb 33, BG379-1 and Kalubalawee Sudurvi 305 (Velusamy et al. 1981); IET 8200, IET 8258 and IET 8283 (Jaswant et al., 1983); B441B126-3-2-1 and BG367-7 (Dhaliwal et al., 1984); IET9705, IET9709, IET9719, IET9711, IET9727, IET9725, IET9723, IET9720, and IET9710 (Rajendran, 1986); TM4506 (Logiswaran et al., 1987); AS13744, RAU4071-57-13 and RP2430-103-56-51 (Subramanian and Velusamy, 1987).Of the 800 varieties studied in Sri Lanka, Dahanala 2220, Dahanala 682 and Kaluheenati 547 showed resistance (Kudagamage, 1977).Thayumanawan et al. (1990) found that resistant varieties have significantly higher contents of total phenols, chlorgenic and gallic acids, making them unacceptable to rice thrips.Chemical ControlAlthough S. biformis is a minor pest of rice, several workers from India, China, Korea, and Bangladesh have investigated the use of different insecticides against this pest.In India, chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, and leptophos were effective as root-dip treatments in newly transplanted rice (Mohanasundaran et al., 1978). Quinalphos, phosalone and carbaryl as sprays afforded control (Barwal and Rao, 1983). Neem oil was found to be as effective as\\u00a0fenthion in controlling S. biformis (Pillai and Ponniah, 1988).In China, thiocyclam and hydrogen oxalate, a preparation developed from an annelid worm, was effective when applied as a spray or a root-zone treatment against thrips (Shang and Chiu, 1981; Chiu, 1985).\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

L. acuta lacks these spots. Barrion and Litsinger (1981) give distinctive characters that separate these two species. L. chinensis, also a pest in rice, is distinguished by a lateral, dark stripe on the thorax. Recently, Barrion and Litsinger (1994) described the taxonomy of 11 species of Leptocorisa that are pests of rice, with identification keys. These species are L. acuta, L. biguttata, L. chinensis, L. costalis, L. luzonica, L. oratorius, L. palawanensis, L. pseudolepida, L. solomonensis, Leptocorisa spp. and L. tagalica.\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms L. acuta adults and nymphs have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by sucking fluid from florets, soft (milky) rice grains and plant sap. They do not bore a hole through the rice hull but enter the grain through the space between the lemma and the palea. They prefer rice at the milk stage but also feed on soft and hard dough rice grains. The removal of liquid milky-white endosperm results in a smaller grain. When the bugs feed on soft or hard dough endosperm, they inject enzymes to predigest the carbohydrate. In the process they contaminate the grain with microorganisms that cause grain discoloration or pecky rice, which more liable to break during milling (Reissig et al., 1986). Feeding enzymes and micro-organisms enhance feeding damage (Srivastava and Saxena, 1967).

Srivastava and Saxena (1967) listed 65 alternative hosts, most of which belong to families Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Alternative hosts include large number of grasses, sorghum, coffee, millets, mulberry, tobacco, oil palm, tea, maize, guava, mango etc. but confirmation that these plants are alternative host of L. acuta is required. During aestivation in winter L. acuta take shelter on or under many plants, which might be recorded as alternative hosts. \", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control   In India, practices such as early sowing of early- and late-maturing rice varieties help to reduce pest damage (Srivastava and Saxena, 1967). Simultaneous crop maturity in all fields in an area reduces rice bug damage. Staggered planting should be avoided. The ability of the insects to survive on weeds and grasses around paddy fields, especially during the off-season, poses a major problem for control strategies. Srivastava and Saxena (1967) recommend clean cultivation of bunds around paddy fields, and periodic burning of grass grown on the bunds and in fallow fields, to prevent breeding of the rice bug and reduce the numbers infesting the next crop.Resistant Crop Varieties Certain coarse-grain-yielding, bearded varieties such as 'Sathi' 'Soma' and 'Mundagakutty' in India are resistant to attack. Resistance is attributed to the fact that the panicle remains enclosed in the leaf sheath and thus offers some mechanical resistance to stylet penetration (see Srivastava and Saxena, 1967). Rice varieties W1263, CR44-82, Badshabhog, Hamasa and CR44-35 have been reported to be most resistant to L. acuta in India (Kalode and Yadava, 1975).Mechanical Control In parts of India and Sri Lanka, smoking the fields by burning certain herbs windward, and passing over the crop baskets, bags or winnows coated on the inside with sticky material, are reported to give promising results. Netting and hand picking are also used to control these bugs. The use of scented aquatic plants such Ceratophyllum demersum, C. submersum, Lycopodium carinatum and Limnophila sp. to trap the bugs has been reported. See Srivastava and Saxena (1967).Chemical Control Where insecticides have to be used, this should be done at the flowering stage, in the evening or on calm days.  In Sri Lanka, various formulations of acephate, fenthion, etc. have been used (PANS, 1982). Pangtey (1985, 1990) evaluated seven insecticides on wet-season rice (June-October) in India, and found malathion dust to be most effective, followed by carbaryl dust. Laboratory determination of the toxicity of 12 insecticides to adults of this bug also indicated that malathion was the most toxic, followed by formothion and\\u00a0fenthion (Krishnakumar and Visalakshi, 1989).Kay et al. (1993) used chlorpyrifos for control of L. acuta on rice in northern Queensland, Australia. In this study,acephate and fention also gave very good or comparable control of the bug.  In Sri Lanka, steam distillates from rice grain at the milky stage have been observed to attract both male and females of this species (Gunawardena and Ranatunga, 1989).Economic Threshold Levels In South Sulawesi, Indonesia, percentage infestation of rice kernels by L. acuta was of the same magnitude as subsequent yield losses (van Halteren et al., 1976). They established a threshold level of 1-2 bugs/m\\u00b2 shortly after flowering. However, Reissig et al. (1986) suggested one bug per rice hill as the economic threshold level.Biological Control The importance of and interest in biological control as a management strategy against slender rice bugs dates to earlier authors including Uichanca (1921) and Corbett (1930) (see Srivastava and Saxena, 1967; Sands, 1977). Much of the detailed information available is on L. oratorius. It is important to maximize natural biological control by conserving the existing natural enemies in the field by avoiding the unnecessary use of insecticides in the field. See Notes on Natural Enemies for further details of potential biocontrol agents. \\u00a0\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Chemical Control   Chemical insecticides have been used to control infestations of N. tenuis on bottle gourds (Lagenaria siceraria) (Sinha et al., 1981; Singh and Rizvi, 1993), sesame (Nath and Pal, 1975; Patnaik and Jena, 1986), tomatoes (Agrawal and Kushwaha, 1978; Patel, 1980) and tobacco (Natarajan and Subramanian, 1977).

Some chemical formulations have given 100% control and resulted in significant increases in crop yield.Biological and Integrated Control There is little information about the parasites and predators of Nesidiocoris spp. Programmes to control N. tenuis biologically have not been attempted for any of the major crops it attacks. The value of N. tenuis as a predator in integrated control programmes against pests of field and glasshouse crops has received considerable attention in recent years. In the field, N. tenuis has been identified as an important predator of the eggs and early instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera on cotton, tobacco and other crops (Marcos and Rejesus, 1992; Patel and Yadav, 1992; Solsoloy et al., 1994). This species has also been observed feeding on Spodoptera litura and other pests of tobacco in India (Patel, 1980). In Spain, N. tenuis, and related mirid predators, were found to play an important role in the integrated pest management of field-grown tomatoes (Goula and Alomar, 1994). The value of N. tenuis as a predator of aleyrodids and other pests of protected crops is discussed by Malausa (1989), Arzone et al.

Coordinated community action is recommended.  Control   Cultural Control and Sanitary Measures Traditional methods of control include community rat campaigns that use trapping, hunting or flushing out rat burrows, and field sanitation. In rice-based systems, food availability may be reduced by synchronous cropping,\\u00a0minimizing grain spillage, ploughing immediately after harvest, and an extended fallow (Stuart et al., 2012; Htwe and Singleton, 2014). Rodent-proofing of storage facilities can be highly successful where feasible. This should be accompanied by sanitation such as removing potential food, water and shelter to make the habitat less attractive to rats. In coconut plantations, trunk banding with metal or plastic sheets may be used.   Chemical Control Rodenticides are a popular method of rat control, but should be used as part of an integrated management approach. Acute and delayed acting toxicants are available for rodent management. Careful assessment of the infestation, appropriate placement and maintenance of bait as well as measures to protect non-target species are recommended. In rice-based agro-ecosystems, baits placed within rice fields are likely to be more attractive and more readily accepted during the tillering stage of the rice crop because food availability is low and pest rodents move into the rice field from the surrounding habitats during this time. When rice plants enter the reproductive stage, the acceptability of rodenticide bait is expected to decline.

In rice nurseries, rats simply chop down the young seedlings and also feed on the endosperm. Rats will feed on the freshly sown seeds as well as on pre-germinated grains. In severe cases, nurseries have had to be re-sown. At the maximum to booting stages of the rice plant, the tillers are gnawed near the base, and the heart of the developing buds and heads are eaten. In the late flowering and grain-filling stages, rats make oblique cuts (usually 60\\u00b0 on the rice stalks carrying the inflorescence). After severe rat damage, only the border plants are left and this is often referred to as the 'stadium' effect. Under very high rat infestation and depredation all the rice plants are attacked and the crop is totally destroyed.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) \", \"Family\": \"Malvaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Arachis hypogaea (groundnut) \", \"Family\": \"Fabaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Capsicum annuum (bell pepper) \", \"Family\": \"Solanaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Cocos nucifera (coconut) \", \"Family\": \"Arecaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Elaeis guineensis (African oil palm) \", \"Family\": \"Arecaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) \", \"Family\": \"Convolvulaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Oryza sativa (rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Theobroma cacao (cocoa) \", \"Family\": \"Malvaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Zea mays (maize) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}]], \"hostsOrSpeciesAffected\": \"Hosts/Species Affected R. argentiventer is omnivorous. It eats flowers, fruits, nuts, leaves, shoots and roots, growing rice plants and the ripening grain, insects such as grasshoppers, termites and ants, snails and slugs and occasionally lizards (Chasen, 1933; Van der Goot, 1951; Harrison, 1954, 1961b; Lim, 1966; Lim and Heyneman, 1968; Wood, 1971a). \", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Introduction   Rodent control methods assume the existence of a direct relationship between rat numbers and rat damage to rice. Control methods involving the use of chemicals are often employed, although cultural, mechanical and biological methods are also available. No single method of control is ideal for all situations and so it is necessary to utilize several techniques to minimize rodent damage.Cultural Control Elimination of harbourage Preventative measures such as the elimination of suitable rat harbourage along field margins and along the banks of canals and drainage ditches contribute greatly towards reducing rat infestation. Ricefields are often surrounded and interspersed with wasteland or uncultivated areas, ditches and roadsides which harbour rats. The removal of cover in these sanctuaries would expose the rats to predators and would also decrease the carrying capacity of the rice fields during the fallow period (Lam, 1991). The size of dykes should be considered. See also (Quick, 1990). Elimination of nesting areas Studies have shown that R. argentiventer prefers higher ground in the ricefields for nesting (Lam, 1980a). The removal of these nesting areas could be achieved by reducing the size of the bunds in the field. This reduction of the available nesting areas would increase intraspecific competition for breeding spaces which would, in the long run, cause the population to decline (Lam, 1980a). Synchronous planting and fallow periods Early maturing fields in rat-infested areas are subjected to severe attacks (Lam, 1991); if this is coupled with depredations by birds at the ripening stage, complete crop loss has been known to occur. Synchronous planting could alleviate the problem in such areas to some extent. Synchronous planting would also ensure that vast areas of ricefield would be fallow at one time, thus reducing the available food and causing the rat population to decline naturally during the fallow period between crops.Mechanical methods Traps The use of traps is one of the oldest methods of rat control. Trapping is quite efficient in removing resident rodents from a small area, but is too costly and laborious for use in rat control over large areas. A large variety of traps are available, ranging from primitive snares to multiple-catch cage traps. The most common traps used are the snap (break-back) and cage traps (Lam, 1982a). Physical killing Rat drives are frequently organized during the post-harvest period; rats are killed with clubs or sticks. If properly organized, this is an effective method of reducing the local rat population quickly and could prevent rat damage during the subsequent sowing. However, this method alone would not be sufficient to protect the following crop and other control measures would also be required. Destruction of nests Another useful measure is the destruction of rat nests and burrows by digging. This would reduce the suitable nesting areas and the rats and nestlings could be killed at the same time. This measure would be particularly useful during the flowering stage of the rice plant when the female rats and young are found in the nests. If it could be organized over a large area, the killing of females and nestlings would prevent a high rat population in the following crop (Lam 1982a). Van der Goot (1951) also described the excavation of rat burrows as a means of control by individual farmers, and the early planting of the second crop to limit damage. Rodent-proofing The use of barriers to exclude rodents is commonly practised in small plots: for example, in nurseries and in experimental areas. In the farmer's field, plastic sheets are used to fence up the nursery areas to prevent rat damage. In experimental plots where important materials are planted, plastic sheets, zinc sheets and electric fences have been used to prevent rodent damage. Electric fences have been used extensively by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines (Ramos, 1970). Rodent-proofing is costly and its use is justified only in research plots where economic considerations are not important and rodent damage cannot be tolerated. Traps-Barrier System (TBS) An innovative approach using a combination of traps and physical barriers was successful in protecting growing rice from severe rat depredation (Lam et al., 1987; Lam, 1988; Lam et al., 1990a; Lam, 1993; Lam and Mooi, 1994). This method is particularly useful in riceland with very high infestations and is also effective in situations where there is a continuous high influx of rats (e.g. 920 rats per night) from the surrounding areas or massive movements (e.g. 6872 rats per night) between ricelands with different planting schedules (Lam et al., 1990a). The traps-barrier system can be used in areas with very high endemic rat infestations, in areas adjacent to large tracts of abandoned riceland and in asynchronously planted areas (Lam, 1991, 1993). Complete yield losses as a result of rat depredation often happen in rice farms in areas where rats are endemic, causing severe hardship to the farmers, particularly those with small farms. In Malaysian ricefields, yield increases of 16 to 7000% were recorded after the implementation of the traps-barrier system (Lam et al., 1990a; Lam and Mooi, 1994). Benefit-cost ratios of 19 to 28 were obtained using plastic fences and a ratio of 7 was obtained for the semi-permanent recycled metal-sheet fence, based on the crop seasons before and after the introduction of the traps-barrier system (Lam, 1993). The traps-barrier system performed extremely well in the Philippines under an evaluation by IRRI from late 1990 (Quick, 1991). IRRI has since introduced this system to its own research farm and also to the Filipino farmers in Caluan and Pila and promoted the use of this system, calling it the 'active barrier system' or ABS (Quick, 1991; Anon., 1992).Murakami et al. (1992) reported the introduction and evaluation of the traps-barrier system for rice rat control in Indonesia. The system was very effective in the protection of nursery areas and in areas where farmers had had to sow at least twice previously because of rat damage in the dry season. Rat damage to the nurseries was reduced to an average of 0.002% with the system (Murakami et al., 1992). A four-hectare study area in Jatisari, West Java, planted 25-30 days later than the surrounding farms, had in the previous seasons sustained very severe rat damage, but with the introduction of this system, rat damage was reduced to only 0.005% in the same four-hectare plot (Murakami et al., 1992). The traps-barrier system was also used successfully to contain rat migration from the surroundings or between areas of different planting schedules in West Java (Murakami et al., 1992). The concept of using rice as a 'trap crop' (Lam, 1988) was used successfully with the traps-barrier system in Jatisari (Murakami et al., 1992).Chemical Control Two approaches are used: poison by ingestion (i.e. use of rodenticides in food baits) and poison by inhalation (i.e. use of fumigants in burrows). Rodenticides Chronic poisons:\\u00a0cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] (Lam, 1992b). For further information on the use of rodenticides and baiting strategies, see Wood (1971), West et al. (1975), Fall (1977), Buckle and Rowe (1981), Lam (1982a, 1990b), Lam et al. (1986), Buckle (1988) and Sumangil (1991). Some of the comparisons between treated and non-treated areas give a dramatic illustration of the losses caused by rats and show the difficulty of assessing this impact simply by observing vegetative symptoms. Rodenticidal dusts Rodenticidal dusts can be used during the reproductive phase of the rice crop if bait acceptance is poor; R. argentiventer begins to breed during this period (Lam, 1980a) and the rats, particularly the pregnant females, are most vulnerable to anti-coagulant poison dust. At this time, rats colonize the bigger field bunds by constructing burrows and nests for reproduction (Lam, 1980a). The occupancy rate is the highest at the reproductive phase of the rice crop and the resident rats could be killed effectively by the application of poison dust containing acute or chronic rodenticides (for further information, see Ooi, 1980; Lam, 1990c). This control method exploits the grooming behaviour of the rats; the poison dust is laid in the burrow entrances and is picked up by the fur and feet and ingested during grooming. Poison dusting of burrows has the limitation that it kills only rats entering the burrows. Hence, the timing of the application of the dust to coincide with the height of burrow-building is crucial for effective control. Fumigants Fumigants may be effective against burrowing animals (depending on how many of the burrows can be found and fumigated and the effect on the population as a whole). Fumigants used have included carbon disulfide (Gallagher, 1908, 1909b; Van der Goot, 1951; Soemartono, 1965; Marsh, 1966; Oei-Dharma, 1969) and aluminium phosphide. Sometimes exhaust gases (carbon monoxide) of tractor engines or smoke from burning or smoldering materials is introduced into the burrows. The introduction of smoke from a burning mixture of rice straw and sulphur is widely used in Indonesia (Fall, 1977); however, at least 5-10 minutes must be allowed for each burrow, making this technique very time-consuming and tedious where the densities of rat burrows are high. When using fumigants in rice fields, the rat holes should be marked and plugged with soil the day before treatment so that only active holes or burrows are fumigated. Data obtained in a study carried out in Bumbong Lima, Malaysia indicated that only 47% of the marked burrows were found to be active (Lam, 1975). The identification of active burrows prior to treatment saves time and money. Although fumigation is an effective means of killing burrowing rodents, it has the limitation that it kills only rats resident in the burrows. Studies have shown that as the rice crop matures, many rats remain in the fields during the day and also that rats may use surface nests in grassy or marshy areas adjacent to the fields (Fall, 1977). Fumigants alone may therefore not be sufficient to protect the growing crop from rodent damage and are best used in combination with other control methods. Fumigants would be particularly useful during the heading and ripening stages during which rats are more attracted to the crop than to poison baits. Also studies have shown that rats, particularly R. argentiventer females, have their young during this period and build their nests in the bunds (Lam, 1980a). Fumigation of burrows during this period would kill the females as well as their young. This would effectively reduce the resident population and prevent the population from reaching an irruptive condition in the following crop.Biological Control In the ricefield environment a number of important predators are present: the small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, the common cobra Naja naja sputatrix, the reticulated python Python reticulatus, the barn owl Tyto alba and the black-winged kite Elanus caeruleus. Lam (1988) reported the presence of the following snake species in rice fields: Pytas korros korros, Elaphe radiata and Natrix trianguligera. Of lesser importance are the Brahminy kite Haliastur indus and the large-billed crows Corvus macrorhynchos. The irony of the situation is that most of these predators are killed by the rice farmers who would otherwise benefit from their rat-eating habits. Especially vulnerable are the snakes and mongoose which the farmer kills on sight. It is important that these animals and birds are protected so that they can reduce the rat population.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Cultural Control  Flooding the field to submerge rice for 2 days is an effective control strategy for rice thrips (Reissig et al., 1986; Pathak and Khan, 1994).Host-Plant ResistanceIn the Philippines, a method was developed to evaluate rice cultivars for resistance to rice thrips in the greenhouse (Nugaliyadde and Heinrichs, 1984b). Resistance was shown by Dahanala 2220, BJ 1, and the following wild rice species: Oryza officinalis, O. eichingeri, O. punctata and O. minuta.In India, the following rice varieties are found resistant to S. biformis: Ptb 33, BG379-1 and Kalubalawee Sudurvi 305 (Velusamy et al. 1981); IET 8200, IET 8258 and IET 8283 (Jaswant et al., 1983); B441B126-3-2-1 and BG367-7 (Dhaliwal et al., 1984); IET9705, IET9709, IET9719, IET9711, IET9727, IET9725, IET9723, IET9720, and IET9710 (Rajendran, 1986); TM4506 (Logiswaran et al., 1987); AS13744, RAU4071-57-13 and RP2430-103-56-51 (Subramanian and Velusamy, 1987).Of the 800 varieties studied in Sri Lanka, Dahanala 2220, Dahanala 682 and Kaluheenati 547 showed resistance (Kudagamage, 1977).Thayumanawan et al. (1990) found that resistant varieties have significantly higher contents of total phenols, chlorgenic and gallic acids, making them unacceptable to rice thrips.Chemical ControlAlthough S. biformis is a minor pest of rice, several workers from India, China, Korea, and Bangladesh have investigated the use of different insecticides against this pest.In India, chlorpyriphos, dimethoate, and leptophos were effective as root-dip treatments in newly transplanted rice (Mohanasundaran et al., 1978). Quinalphos, phosalone and carbaryl as sprays afforded control (Barwal and Rao, 1983). Neem oil was found to be as effective as\\u00a0fenthion in controlling S. biformis (Pillai and Ponniah, 1988).In China, thiocyclam and hydrogen oxalate, a preparation developed from an annelid worm, was effective when applied as a spray or a root-zone treatment against thrips (Shang and Chiu, 1981; Chiu, 1985).\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

L. acuta lacks these spots. Barrion and Litsinger (1981) give distinctive characters that separate these two species. L. chinensis, also a pest in rice, is distinguished by a lateral, dark stripe on the thorax. Recently, Barrion and Litsinger (1994) described the taxonomy of 11 species of Leptocorisa that are pests of rice, with identification keys. These species are L. acuta, L. biguttata, L. chinensis, L. costalis, L. luzonica, L. oratorius, L. palawanensis, L. pseudolepida, L. solomonensis, Leptocorisa spp. and L. tagalica.\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms L. acuta adults and nymphs have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by sucking fluid from florets, soft (milky) rice grains and plant sap.

They prefer rice at the milk stage but also feed on soft and hard dough rice grains. The removal of liquid milky-white endosperm results in a smaller grain. When the bugs feed on soft or hard dough endosperm, they inject enzymes to predigest the carbohydrate. In the process they contaminate the grain with microorganisms that cause grain discoloration or pecky rice, which more liable to break during milling (Reissig et al., 1986). Feeding enzymes and micro-organisms enhance feeding damage (Srivastava and Saxena, 1967).

Srivastava and Saxena (1967) listed 65 alternative hosts, most of which belong to families Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Alternative hosts include large number of grasses, sorghum, coffee, millets, mulberry, tobacco, oil palm, tea, maize, guava, mango etc. but confirmation that these plants are alternative host of L. acuta is required. During aestivation in winter L. acuta take shelter on or under many plants, which might be recorded as alternative hosts. \", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control   In India, practices such as early sowing of early- and late-maturing rice varieties help to reduce pest damage (Srivastava and Saxena, 1967). Simultaneous crop maturity in all fields in an area reduces rice bug damage. Staggered planting should be avoided. The ability of the insects to survive on weeds and grasses around paddy fields, especially during the off-season, poses a major problem for control strategies. Srivastava and Saxena (1967) recommend clean cultivation of bunds around paddy fields, and periodic burning of grass grown on the bunds and in fallow fields, to prevent breeding of the rice bug and reduce the numbers infesting the next crop.Resistant Crop Varieties Certain coarse-grain-yielding, bearded varieties such as 'Sathi' 'Soma' and 'Mundagakutty' in India are resistant to attack. Resistance is attributed to the fact that the panicle remains enclosed in the leaf sheath and thus offers some mechanical resistance to stylet penetration (see Srivastava and Saxena, 1967). Rice varieties W1263, CR44-82, Badshabhog, Hamasa and CR44-35 have been reported to be most resistant to L. acuta in India (Kalode and Yadava, 1975).Mechanical Control In parts of India and Sri Lanka, smoking the fields by burning certain herbs windward, and passing over the crop baskets, bags or winnows coated on the inside with sticky material, are reported to give promising results. Netting and hand picking are also used to control these bugs. The use of scented aquatic plants such Ceratophyllum demersum, C. submersum, Lycopodium carinatum and Limnophila sp. to trap the bugs has been reported. See Srivastava and Saxena (1967).Chemical Control Where insecticides have to be used, this should be done at the flowering stage, in the evening or on calm days.  In Sri Lanka, various formulations of acephate, fenthion, etc. have been used (PANS, 1982). Pangtey (1985, 1990) evaluated seven insecticides on wet-season rice (June-October) in India, and found malathion dust to be most effective, followed by carbaryl dust. Laboratory determination of the toxicity of 12 insecticides to adults of this bug also indicated that malathion was the most toxic, followed by formothion and\\u00a0fenthion (Krishnakumar and Visalakshi, 1989).Kay et al. (1993) used chlorpyrifos for control of L. acuta on rice in northern Queensland, Australia. In this study,acephate and fention also gave very good or comparable control of the bug.  In Sri Lanka, steam distillates from rice grain at the milky stage have been observed to attract both male and females of this species (Gunawardena and Ranatunga, 1989).Economic Threshold Levels In South Sulawesi, Indonesia, percentage infestation of rice kernels by L. acuta was of the same magnitude as subsequent yield losses (van Halteren et al., 1976). They established a threshold level of 1-2 bugs/m\\u00b2 shortly after flowering. However, Reissig et al. (1986) suggested one bug per rice hill as the economic threshold level.Biological Control The importance of and interest in biological control as a management strategy against slender rice bugs dates to earlier authors including Uichanca (1921) and Corbett (1930) (see Srivastava and Saxena, 1967; Sands, 1977). Much of the detailed information available is on L. oratorius. It is important to maximize natural biological control by conserving the existing natural enemies in the field by avoiding the unnecessary use of insecticides in the field. See Notes on Natural Enemies for further details of potential biocontrol agents. \\u00a0\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Chemical Control   Chemical insecticides have been used to control infestations of N. tenuis on bottle gourds (Lagenaria siceraria) (Sinha et al., 1981; Singh and Rizvi, 1993), sesame (Nath and Pal, 1975; Patnaik and Jena, 1986), tomatoes (Agrawal and Kushwaha, 1978; Patel, 1980) and tobacco (Natarajan and Subramanian, 1977).

Some chemical formulations have given 100% control and resulted in significant increases in crop yield.Biological and Integrated Control There is little information about the parasites and predators of Nesidiocoris spp. Programmes to control N. tenuis biologically have not been attempted for any of the major crops it attacks. The value of N. tenuis as a predator in integrated control programmes against pests of field and glasshouse crops has received considerable attention in recent years. In the field, N. tenuis has been identified as an important predator of the eggs and early instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera on cotton, tobacco and other crops (Marcos and Rejesus, 1992; Patel and Yadav, 1992; Solsoloy et al., 1994). This species has also been observed feeding on Spodoptera litura and other pests of tobacco in India (Patel, 1980). In Spain, N. tenuis, and related mirid predators, were found to play an important role in the integrated pest management of field-grown tomatoes (Goula and Alomar, 1994). The value of N. tenuis as a predator of aleyrodids and other pests of protected crops is discussed by Malausa (1989), Arzone et al.

Coordinated community action is recommended.  Control   Cultural Control and Sanitary Measures Traditional methods of control include community rat campaigns that use trapping, hunting or flushing out rat burrows, and field sanitation. In rice-based systems, food availability may be reduced by synchronous cropping,\\u00a0minimizing grain spillage, ploughing immediately after harvest, and an extended fallow (Stuart et al., 2012; Htwe and Singleton, 2014). Rodent-proofing of storage facilities can be highly successful where feasible. This should be accompanied by sanitation such as removing potential food, water and shelter to make the habitat less attractive to rats. In coconut plantations, trunk banding with metal or plastic sheets may be used.   Chemical Control Rodenticides are a popular method of rat control, but should be used as part of an integrated management approach. Acute and delayed acting toxicants are available for rodent management. Careful assessment of the infestation, appropriate placement and maintenance of bait as well as measures to protect non-target species are recommended. In rice-based agro-ecosystems, baits placed within rice fields are likely to be more attractive and more readily accepted during the tillering stage of the rice crop because food availability is low and pest rodents move into the rice field from the surrounding habitats during this time. When rice plants enter the reproductive stage, the acceptability of rodenticide bait is expected to decline.   Monitoring and Surveillance Rodent damage to rice crops generally occurs towards the centre of the crop and is not readily visible until damage is greater than 10%.

In rice nurseries, rats simply chop down the young seedlings and also feed on the endosperm. Rats will feed on the freshly sown seeds as well as on pre-germinated grains. In severe cases, nurseries have had to be re-sown. At the maximum to booting stages of the rice plant, the tillers are gnawed near the base, and the heart of the developing buds and heads are eaten. In the late flowering and grain-filling stages, rats make oblique cuts (usually 60\\u00b0 on the rice stalks carrying the inflorescence). After severe rat damage, only the border plants are left and this is often referred to as the 'stadium' effect.

It eats flowers, fruits, nuts, leaves, shoots and roots, growing rice plants and the ripening grain, insects such as grasshoppers, termites and ants, snails and slugs and occasionally lizards (Chasen, 1933; Van der Goot, 1951; Harrison, 1954, 1961b; Lim, 1966; Lim and Heyneman, 1968; Wood, 1971a). \", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Introduction   Rodent control methods assume the existence of a direct relationship between rat numbers and rat damage to rice. Control methods involving the use of chemicals are often employed, although cultural, mechanical and biological methods are also available. No single method of control is ideal for all situations and so it is necessary to utilize several techniques to minimize rodent damage.Cultural Control Elimination of harbourage Preventative measures such as the elimination of suitable rat harbourage along field margins and along the banks of canals and drainage ditches contribute greatly towards reducing rat infestation. Ricefields are often surrounded and interspersed with wasteland or uncultivated areas, ditches and roadsides which harbour rats. The removal of cover in these sanctuaries would expose the rats to predators and would also decrease the carrying capacity of the rice fields during the fallow period (Lam, 1991). The size of dykes should be considered. See also (Quick, 1990). Elimination of nesting areas Studies have shown that R. argentiventer prefers higher ground in the ricefields for nesting (Lam, 1980a). The removal of these nesting areas could be achieved by reducing the size of the bunds in the field. This reduction of the available nesting areas would increase intraspecific competition for breeding spaces which would, in the long run, cause the population to decline (Lam, 1980a). Synchronous planting and fallow periods Early maturing fields in rat-infested areas are subjected to severe attacks (Lam, 1991); if this is coupled with depredations by birds at the ripening stage, complete crop loss has been known to occur. Synchronous planting could alleviate the problem in such areas to some extent. Synchronous planting would also ensure that vast areas of ricefield would be fallow at one time, thus reducing the available food and causing the rat population to decline naturally during the fallow period between crops.Mechanical methods Traps The use of traps is one of the oldest methods of rat control. Trapping is quite efficient in removing resident rodents from a small area, but is too costly and laborious for use in rat control over large areas. A large variety of traps are available, ranging from primitive snares to multiple-catch cage traps. The most common traps used are the snap (break-back) and cage traps (Lam, 1982a). Physical killing Rat drives are frequently organized during the post-harvest period; rats are killed with clubs or sticks. If properly organized, this is an effective method of reducing the local rat population quickly and could prevent rat damage during the subsequent sowing. However, this method alone would not be sufficient to protect the following crop and other control measures would also be required. Destruction of nests Another useful measure is the destruction of rat nests and burrows by digging. This would reduce the suitable nesting areas and the rats and nestlings could be killed at the same time. This measure would be particularly useful during the flowering stage of the rice plant when the female rats and young are found in the nests. If it could be organized over a large area, the killing of females and nestlings would prevent a high rat population in the following crop (Lam 1982a). Van der Goot (1951) also described the excavation of rat burrows as a means of control by individual farmers, and the early planting of the second crop to limit damage. Rodent-proofing The use of barriers to exclude rodents is commonly practised in small plots: for example, in nurseries and in experimental areas. In the farmer's field, plastic sheets are used to fence up the nursery areas to prevent rat damage. In experimental plots where important materials are planted, plastic sheets, zinc sheets and electric fences have been used to prevent rodent damage. Electric fences have been used extensively by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines (Ramos, 1970). Rodent-proofing is costly and its use is justified only in research plots where economic considerations are not important and rodent damage cannot be tolerated. Traps-Barrier System (TBS) An innovative approach using a combination of traps and physical barriers was successful in protecting growing rice from severe rat depredation (Lam et al., 1987; Lam, 1988; Lam et al., 1990a; Lam, 1993; Lam and Mooi, 1994). This method is particularly useful in riceland with very high infestations and is also effective in situations where there is a continuous high influx of rats (e.g. 920 rats per night) from the surrounding areas or massive movements (e.g. 6872 rats per night) between ricelands with different planting schedules (Lam et al., 1990a). The traps-barrier system can be used in areas with very high endemic rat infestations, in areas adjacent to large tracts of abandoned riceland and in asynchronously planted areas (Lam, 1991, 1993). Complete yield losses as a result of rat depredation often happen in rice farms in areas where rats are endemic, causing severe hardship to the farmers, particularly those with small farms. In Malaysian ricefields, yield increases of 16 to 7000% were recorded after the implementation of the traps-barrier system (Lam et al., 1990a; Lam and Mooi, 1994). Benefit-cost ratios of 19 to 28 were obtained using plastic fences and a ratio of 7 was obtained for the semi-permanent recycled metal-sheet fence, based on the crop seasons before and after the introduction of the traps-barrier system (Lam, 1993). The traps-barrier system performed extremely well in the Philippines under an evaluation by IRRI from late 1990 (Quick, 1991). IRRI has since introduced this system to its own research farm and also to the Filipino farmers in Caluan and Pila and promoted the use of this system, calling it the 'active barrier system' or ABS (Quick, 1991; Anon., 1992).Murakami et al. (1992) reported the introduction and evaluation of the traps-barrier system for rice rat control in Indonesia. The system was very effective in the protection of nursery areas and in areas where farmers had had to sow at least twice previously because of rat damage in the dry season. Rat damage to the nurseries was reduced to an average of 0.002% with the system (Murakami et al., 1992). A four-hectare study area in Jatisari, West Java, planted 25-30 days later than the surrounding farms, had in the previous seasons sustained very severe rat damage, but with the introduction of this system, rat damage was reduced to only 0.005% in the same four-hectare plot (Murakami et al., 1992). The traps-barrier system was also used successfully to contain rat migration from the surroundings or between areas of different planting schedules in West Java (Murakami et al., 1992). The concept of using rice as a 'trap crop' (Lam, 1988) was used successfully with the traps-barrier system in Jatisari (Murakami et al., 1992).Chemical Control Two approaches are used: poison by ingestion (i.e. use of rodenticides in food baits) and poison by inhalation (i.e. use of fumigants in burrows). Rodenticides Chronic poisons:\\u00a0cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] (Lam, 1992b). For further information on the use of rodenticides and baiting strategies, see Wood (1971), West et al. (1975), Fall (1977), Buckle and Rowe (1981), Lam (1982a, 1990b), Lam et al. (1986), Buckle (1988) and Sumangil (1991). Some of the comparisons between treated and non-treated areas give a dramatic illustration of the losses caused by rats and show the difficulty of assessing this impact simply by observing vegetative symptoms. Rodenticidal dusts Rodenticidal dusts can be used during the reproductive phase of the rice crop if bait acceptance is poor; R. argentiventer begins to breed during this period (Lam, 1980a) and the rats, particularly the pregnant females, are most vulnerable to anti-coagulant poison dust. At this time, rats colonize the bigger field bunds by constructing burrows and nests for reproduction (Lam, 1980a). The occupancy rate is the highest at the reproductive phase of the rice crop and the resident rats could be killed effectively by the application of poison dust containing acute or chronic rodenticides (for further information, see Ooi, 1980; Lam, 1990c). This control method exploits the grooming behaviour of the rats; the poison dust is laid in the burrow entrances and is picked up by the fur and feet and ingested during grooming. Poison dusting of burrows has the limitation that it kills only rats entering the burrows. Hence, the timing of the application of the dust to coincide with the height of burrow-building is crucial for effective control. Fumigants Fumigants may be effective against burrowing animals (depending on how many of the burrows can be found and fumigated and the effect on the population as a whole). Fumigants used have included carbon disulfide (Gallagher, 1908, 1909b; Van der Goot, 1951; Soemartono, 1965; Marsh, 1966; Oei-Dharma, 1969) and aluminium phosphide. Sometimes exhaust gases (carbon monoxide) of tractor engines or smoke from burning or smoldering materials is introduced into the burrows. The introduction of smoke from a burning mixture of rice straw and sulphur is widely used in Indonesia (Fall, 1977); however, at least 5-10 minutes must be allowed for each burrow, making this technique very time-consuming and tedious where the densities of rat burrows are high. When using fumigants in rice fields, the rat holes should be marked and plugged with soil the day before treatment so that only active holes or burrows are fumigated. Data obtained in a study carried out in Bumbong Lima, Malaysia indicated that only 47% of the marked burrows were found to be active (Lam, 1975). The identification of active burrows prior to treatment saves time and money. Although fumigation is an effective means of killing burrowing rodents, it has the limitation that it kills only rats resident in the burrows. Studies have shown that as the rice crop matures, many rats remain in the fields during the day and also that rats may use surface nests in grassy or marshy areas adjacent to the fields (Fall, 1977). Fumigants alone may therefore not be sufficient to protect the growing crop from rodent damage and are best used in combination with other control methods. Fumigants would be particularly useful during the heading and ripening stages during which rats are more attracted to the crop than to poison baits. Also studies have shown that rats, particularly R. argentiventer females, have their young during this period and build their nests in the bunds (Lam, 1980a). Fumigation of burrows during this period would kill the females as well as their young. This would effectively reduce the resident population and prevent the population from reaching an irruptive condition in the following crop.Biological Control In the ricefield environment a number of important predators are present: the small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, the common cobra Naja naja sputatrix, the reticulated python Python reticulatus, the barn owl Tyto alba and the black-winged kite Elanus caeruleus. Lam (1988) reported the presence of the following snake species in rice fields: Pytas korros korros, Elaphe radiata and Natrix trianguligera. Of lesser importance are the Brahminy kite Haliastur indus and the large-billed crows Corvus macrorhynchos. The irony of the situation is that most of these predators are killed by the rice farmers who would otherwise benefit from their rat-eating habits. Especially vulnerable are the snakes and mongoose which the farmer kills on sight. It is important that these animals and birds are protected so that they can reduce the rat population.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

For instance, bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, bacterial leaf streak caused by X. oryzae pv. oryzicola and sheath brown rot caused by Pseudomonas fuscovaginae, all infect aerial parts of rice plants and might be misidentified as A. oryzae infection. For a detailed description of each of these bacterial diseases and their differentiative characteristics, refer to Cartwright et al. (2018). Furthermore, A. oryzae and A. avenae are closely related and often not easy to differentiate from each other, which can result in inaccurate identification based on traditional methods such as carbon source utilization profile, fatty acid methyl esters and ELISA detection tests (Schaad et al., 2008).\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms Symptoms of bacterial brown stripe of rice include water-soaked streaks at the leaf-sheath base, sometimes extending into the blade and becoming dark or purplish brown leading to leaf yellowing, stunting and death. Symptoms vary slightly on different parts of the plant. A detailed description of symptoms of bacterial brown stripe of rice is provided by Kadota and Ohuchi (1990).  Leaf symptoms: On leaves, symptoms include long, narrow, reddish-brown stripes that vary in length and are sharply delineated by uninfected adjacent vascular bundles.  Seedling stage: In the seedling stage, disease symptoms include inhibition of germination, brown stripe on the leaf, curving of the leaf sheath and abnormal elongation of the mesocotyl. Inhibition of germination prevails in the seeds that have started to germinate. Heavily infected seeds die without germination. If germinated, the coleoptile of approximately 1 cm growth, turns pale yellowish brown accompanied by a water-soaked region, and stops growing. If they do not die, the infected seedlings grow less than healthy ones. One side of the leaf sheath grows better than the other, resulting in the leaf sheath being curved like a bow. Growth of the seminal roots of the curved seedlings is usually retarded remarkably. Seedlings showing these symptoms usually die before the third or fourth leaf stage. Under greenhouse conditions, diseased seedlings show water-soaked areas on coleoptiles and brown stripes on leaf sheaths and midribs.  Tillering stage: Transplantation of the infected seedlings to paddy fields results in the symptoms being masked. Disease symptoms could not be seen at the tillering stage.  Panicle formation stage: Disease symptoms occur at the panicle formation stage. Water-soaked and dark-green spots are seen on the leaf sheaths of the plants. A long and slender brown stripe is seen along the midrib of the new leaves. Young unfolding leaves turn dark brown and eventually die. Elongation of the first and second internodes, curving of the rachis, reduction of rachis branches and abnormal elongation of the palea and lemma to the long axis are observed.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Oryza sativa (rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"    Schaad et al. (2008)    \"}]], \"hostsOrSpeciesAffected\": \"Hosts/Species Affected The former complex species Acidovorax avenae (including the strains now known as A. oryzae) causes a wide range of economically important diseases on monocotyledonous plants (Fontana et al., 2019). However, individual strains infect only one or a few host species (Kawaguchi et al., 2021). Schaad et al. (2008) noted that all strains isolated from rice were pathogenic on both rice and maize while the strains isolated from maize were pathogenic on maize but not rice. Furthermore, maize strains differed in their pathogenicity on wheat, while rice strains were not pathogenic to wheat at all. According to Baraoidan (1981), the causal agent of brown stripe of rice isolated from infected seedlings was pathogenic on rice but not to common grass weeds. A comprehensive host range test using an entire set of representative strains isolated from different poaceous plants is warranted to shed light on the natural and experimental host range of the members of A. avenae.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Control  Acidovorax oryzae is a seedborne pathogen, and infected seedlings play a pivotal role in the establishment and dissemination of the disease in rice fields. An effective method for controlling bacterial brown stripe is to maintain appropriate levels of temperature and humidity when growing rice seedlings and use healthy seeds tested for high germination before planting (Kadota and Ohuchi, 1990). Implementation of regulatory rules at the seedling transplantation stage could reduce the cost and effort needed for disease control under the field conditions. Most of the studies on the management of bacterial brown stripe of rice were conducted before the reclassification of the causal agent. Hence, the taxonomic status of the pathogen needs to be clarified by sampling and pathogen identification to ensure that a correct management strategy is being applied.   Biological Control The halotolerant species, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, exhibited strong in vitro and in vivo antagonistic activity against A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2018). However, the use of this antagonist under field conditions for the management of bacterial brown stripe has not yet been approved.   Chemical Control After reclassification of the causal agent of bacterial brown stripe of rice as A. oryzae (Schaad et al., 2008), species-specific investigations have rarely been conducted to find conventional chemicals for disease management. However, a number of novel chemicals based on nanotechnology gave promising results in vitro and under greenhouse conditions for the management of A. oryzae. Using fresh fruit extract of Phyllanthus emblica, low-cost biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was reported to combat the growth of A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2019). At 20 \\u03bcg/ml the nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2019). Bioengineered chitosan-magnesium nano-composite was reported as an antimicrobial agent against A. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani [Thanatephorus cucumeris] for sustainable rice production. The chitosan-magnesium nano-composite showed antimicrobial activity against A. oryzae and significantly inhibited the growth of the pathogen as compared to a non-treated control (Ahmed et al., 2021a). Magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgONPs) produced by Acinetobacter johnsonii showed antibacterial activity against A. oryzae where substantial antibacterial activity was exhibited by the MgONPs in culture-based tests and ultrastructure studies (Ahmed et al., 2021b). Furthermore, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from pomelo (Citrus maxima) fruit extract can play an important role in controlling A. oryzae (Ali et al., 2020). Ogunyemi et al. (2019) showed that synthesized magnesium oxide (MgO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles using Matricaria chamomilla [Chamomilla recutita] extract could serve as an alternative approach for the management of A. oryzae. Three thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) analogues significantly inhibited in vitro growth of A. oryzae. The three ThDP analogues significantly reduced biofilm formation and the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase of the pathogen (Wang et al., 2019). The use of auto sprouters for propagation in rice, in which the temperature is kept at 30-32\\u00b0C under aerobic conditions, facilitates survival of the bacteria. Applications of kasugamycin to the auto sprouters during incubation may be used for control (Yaoita et al., 1988); soil applications in the nursery have given good control without any rice injury (Hiramatsu et al., 1989). The emergence of kasugamycin antibiotic-resistant A. oryzae and Burkholderia glumae, which cause rice bacterial brown stripe and rice bacterial grain and seedling rot, respectively, is a serious threat for the effective control of these diseases (Yoshii et al., 2015). Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) analogues have been designed and synthesized based on the ThDP binding site of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex E1 of Escherichia coli. The application of synthesized ThDP analogues might be a tractable strategy to overcome the pathogen of rice bacterial brown stripe (Wang et al., 2019).   Host Resistance (Incl. Vaccination) No rice cultivar has so far been reported to be resistant to A. oryzae. Sato et al. (1983) observed varietal differences in symptom expression during laboratory tests with inoculated seeds. It has been shown that expression of a bacterial flagellin gene from A. oryzae strain N1141 triggers plant immune responses and confers disease resistance in transgenic rice plants (Takakura et al., 2008). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

When an empty glume dies, severe smudge of the kernels is observed (Taketani and Yagi, 1982).

Yellow-brown spots of varying shape were formed on leaves and sheaths after incubation they yielded C. verruculosa, this is the first report on Cynodon in China (Huang et al., 2005).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods   Various publications provide information on the impact of fertilizer (Narinder-Singh et al., 1987), soil type (Furlani et al., 1975), plant spacing (Agarwal et al., 1975) and planting time (Rush, 1973), but all of these studies relate to several pathogens that affect seed infection, including Curvularia spp.  UCIPM (2009) highlights the importance of applying the correct amount of fertiliser, reducing soil compaction, providing good soil drainange and management of the thatch layer, keeping it under 0.5 inches in thickness.Host-Plant Resistance In samples of 15 rice varieties produced in 1935 at the Rice Experiment Station, Beaumont, Texas, black kernels ranged from 0.04% in Rexoro to 1.l% in Caloro (Marchionatto and Altstat, 1940). Rice collected in 1938 from the Texas rice area indicated that Shoemed and Fortuna were more severely affected that year than Roxoro, Lady Wright, Blue Rose, Caloro, Deltius, and Early Prolific (Atkins, 1974). Nearly 7% of plants of the cultivars IR20 and TKM9 growing in experimental plots at the end of the 1990 dry season showed dark brown lesions, mostly on the sheath enclosing the young panicle. Panicles emerging from diseased plants were mostly black. The pathogen was identified as C. lunata [Cochliobolus lunatus], not previously reported as a cause of sheath rot. In inoculation tests on 23 cultivars only six remained disease-free (Lakshmanan, 1991). In field trials in 1971, 1972 and 1975, five cultivars were inoculated in the spike at the pre-emergence stage with conidia of Cochliobolus lunatus isolated from rice. None of the cultivars was resistant and incidence was high (Hermida Laffitte et al., 1980).  Audilakshmi et al. (1999) found a strong association between glume color and grain mold resistance. It has been suggested that it is possible to enhance grain mold resistance in white-grained sorghum by incorporating coloured-glume character.Chemical Control  Specific control measures are lacking for black kernel, but spraying with broad-spectrum fungicides can effectively arrest infestation over glumes and other plant parts (Misra et al., 1994b). Thiram and methoxyethyl-mercury chloride reduced the number of isolations of leaf surface fungi, but two insecticides had no significant effect. Frequency of pathogenic Curvularia spp. increased with successive applications of all chemicals. Re-colonization was more rapid on leaves treated with fungicide-insecticide combinations than with either of the chemicals alone (Kuthubutheen, 1984). Discoloration caused by Helminthosporium and Cochliobolus lunatus was controlled by applications of guazatine, IBP and mancozeb (Duraisamy,1982). Grain infection by Helminthosporium oryzae [Cochliobolus miyabeanus] and Curvularia sp., and some other pathogens in IR20 under wet field conditions, was least in plots treated with\\u00a0copper oxychloride, once at the milky stage and again one week later (Govindarajan and Kannaiyan, 1982). In soils treated with carboxin the predominant fungi were Curvularia sp., Alternaria sp. and Mycogone sp.. With the exception of Alternaria sp., Rhizopus sp. and Syncephalastrum sp., all fungi appearing in treated soils were also found in untreated soils. The changing fungal flora in treated and untreated soils are compared and tabulated (Ganesan and Lalithakumari, 1991).  Vitavax, Thiram and Mancozeb eradicated the majority of seed-borne Curvularia lunata (Huynh and Ashok, 2005).Biological Control Potential biological control agents for several seedborne pathogens of rice, including Curvularia spp., have been examined, but no control practice currently exists (Shubha et al., 1992; Manasi-Mishra et al., 1990).\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Initial symptoms often begin with the yellowing of leaf tips, which then develop into yellow to orange discolouration of the leaves. In young plants, few tillers are produced and root development is incomplete. The plants, especially the younger ones, become stunted with small panicles and often unviable, deformed seeds. Localisation of the virus in vascular tissues reduces soluble sugars and causes an increase in the starch and amino acids in the plant (Azzam and Chancellor, 2002).  The disease is sometimes difficult to detect due to the variation in symptom expression, but it can result in losses of up to 74% (Ling, 1972). Brown, irregular blotches develop on leaves, and are more common on the younger plants. Leaves may also become mottled, or have light-green to white stripes parallel to the leaf veins (Hibino, 1996). If infection occurs at a young age, shortening of the leaf blade and leaf sheath result in the stunting of the plant. Root development is poor and flower development takes longer, which delays maturity and the panicles do not develop or exsert properly. Fewer grains are produced, and those that are yielded, have a reduced weight and may be coated in brown blotches (Suparyono et al., 2012).\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Oryza sativa (rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}]], \"hostsOrSpeciesAffected\": \"\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

No other clearly-defined species of Alternaria-like fungus occurs on rice (Simmons, 2007). The species reported on Sorghum vulgare, Alternaria sorghicola, produces conidia from branched conidiophores, conidia in chains that have both transverse and longitudinal septa, with or without long beaks that terminate in cells that are secondary conidiophores (Simmons, 2007). A number of other fungi cause seed rot and seedling blight (Ou, 1985; Rush, 1992), sheath rot (Naeimi et al., 2003), and grain discolouration (Tullis, 1936; Padwick, 1950; Saini, 1985; Lee, 1992b) of rice. Among these is the brown spot pathogen, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, which also produces small spots on leaves. The lesions are pale brown to grey with a reddish-brown margin. The conidia are fusiform to almost cylindrical, curved, pale to golden brown, 63-153 x 14-22 \\u00b5m, beakless, with up to three times as many apparent transverse septa as occur in T. padwickii, (Lee, 1992a).\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms This seed-borne fungus causes pre- and post-emergence seed rot (Srinivasaiah et al., 1984).

Spots on later leaves, only occasionally seen, are oval to circular, 3-10 mm diameter and tan, later becoming grey to white with a narrow, dark-brown border (Padwick, 1950). Sheath rot in rice caused by T. padwickii, among other fungi, was reported for the first time by Naeimi et al. (2003) in northern Iran. In the 'stackburn' phase of the disease, spots on glumes are pale brown to white or faintly pink or reddish-brown, usually with a darker border (Groth, 1992). Infected grain is dark coloured, chalky, brittle, and/or shriveled, with reduced viability (Lee, 1992b; Groth 1992).

This fungus has also been reported in India on seeds of millet (Pennisetum typhoides [Pennisetum glaucum]) in Uttar Pradesh (Mathur et al., 1973), on seeds of Sorghum halepense (Mathur and Prakash, 1977), on eucalyptus in Kerala (Thankamma and Nair, 1989), and on the invasive weed, Marsilea quadrifolia (Sarbhoy et al., 1971). In Brazil, it is recorded on the grass, Brachiariadecumbens [Urochloa decumbens] as well as on rice (Mendes et al., 1998).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Prevention   SPS Measures  The testing and certification of rice seed is necessary to prevent the importation of this seedborne pathogen into new areas or the increase of inoculum in already infested areas. The fungus has been detected in seed of exotic germplasm imported to India (Agarwal et al., 2006) as well as in inert matter contaminating local seed lots in Bangladesh (Khokon et al., 2005). In New Zealand, T. padwickii was detected only in seed lots of foreign origin, not in the native ones (Lau and Sheridan, 1975).   Control   Cultural Control and Sanitary Measures  Padwick (1950) recommended destruction of rice stubble and straw by burning. A row spacing trial (15, 20, and 25 cm wide) showed that seedborne infections were highest with the closest spacing. Seed infection also increased proportionally as nitrogenous fertilizer applications were increased from 0 to 200 kg/ha (Agarwal et al., 1975).   Physical/Mechanical Control  Hand cleaning of farmers\\u2019 seed was found effective in improving seed germination and seedling vigour in Bangladesh (Mathur et al., 2004). The hot water treatment of seed is an alternative to cleaning and the use of chemicals, but may reduce the level of germination.  Tisdale (1922) found that, after a pre-soaking period of 16 hours in tepid water, soaking seed for 15 minutes in water at 54\\u00b0C gave the best results for germination and disinfection.  In India, Suryanarayan et al. (1963) recommended the use of 50\\u00b0C water for 10 minutes, but germination was reduced to 62%. Alternative variations gave improved germination, but did not completely eliminate infection.  The proper drying of the grain before storage should reduce later development of infection (Lee, 1992b).   Biological Control  A formulation of rice rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens, in powdered talc, was effective in reducing seedling infection by T. padwickii and Bipolaris oryzae when applied to seeds at the rates of 5 and 10 g per kg (Praveen Kumar et al., 2001).   Chemical Control  Several fungicide sprays gave satisfactory control of grain discolouration, including: chlorothalonil, mancozeb, carboxin, and fenapanil (Ferrer et al., 1980); polyoxin (Arunyanart et al., 1981);\\u00a0iprobenfos and benomyl (Rajan and Nair, 1979); and iprodione (Rodriguez et al., 1988).  Despite the deep-seated nature of seed infection, several seed-treatment fungicides are reported as giving control of seed infection, including\\u00a0iprobenfos and benomyl (Rajan and Nair, 1979); N-ethylmercurio-4-toluenesulfonanilide (Aleshin et al., 1980); and mancozeb (Vir et al., 1971). Seed treatment with hot water or mancozeb appears to be essential to control seedborne infection in high-yielding rice cultivars (Rath, 1974).  Chemicals from natural sources may provide control that is less toxic to mammals and less polluting in the environment. Shanmugam (2004) tested leaf extracts of twenty plant species and found that a 10% concentration of the extract of Prosopis juliflora (mesquite) had an inhibitory effect equivalent to that of a fungicide on mycelial growth and spore germination of seed-borne fungi of rice, including T. padwickii. The essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes of Curcuma longa (turmeric) are also effective against the fungus, but at higher concentrations (Behura et al., 2000). Seeking a treatment available to small farmers in Cameroon, Nguefack et al. (2008) tested the essential oils of three locally-grown plants applied as a slurry to rice seed. Those of Ocimum gratissimum (African basil) and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) had an effect similar to that of mancozeb in reducing transmission of fungi from seeds to seedlings. A natural chemical, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, isolated from the Indian plant, Decalepis hamiltonii was almost as effective as thiram as a treatment against T. padwickii and other seed-borne fungi (Devihalli Chikkaiah et al., 2009).   Host Resistance  Although Rath (1974) reported no resistance to T. padwickii in high-yielding rice cultivars, some breeding lines were found resistant in nursery tests in Java, Indonesia (Soepriaman et al., 1976). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness  T. padwickii, previously known as Alternaria padwickii, is an asexually reproducing fungus that infects seeds of rice [Oryza sativa]. It is one of several fungi responsible for seed discolouration, seed rot and seedling blight, but has also been detected as a sheath-rotting pathogen (Naeimi et al., 2003). It occurs in southern Asia and in countries on other continents worldwide, but its presence in mainland North America is not confirmed. Transport to and transmission in new areas may be prevented by use of tested clean seed. Where the pathogen is already present, application of seed treatments should reduce disease incidence, but the fungus has an undetermined ability to survive as sclerotia in plant debris and soil.\"}\n",

Many plant species have been incorrectly listed as host plants of L. striatellus, because the adult planthoppers actively disperse and probe their stylets on a variety of plants and substrates. Strictly, for a plant to be listed as a host of L. striatellus, the eggs and nymphs should be detected, and a substantial population of the planthoppers established, on the plant in the field. For example, maize is infected by viruses transmitted by L. striatellus but is not listed as a host plant of this species as it is unlikely that the planthoppers establish a population on maize (Conti, 1984; Harpaz, 1961).Agropyron repens, Briza spp., Bromus arvensis and Lagurus ovatus have been identified as host plants of L. striatellus in laboratory tests, but field tests are necessary to confirm whether they are host plants for this species.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Host-Plant Resistance   Resistant cultivars are recognized as the most economic and effective measure for controlling the insect. Resistant varieties are being developed by introgression of resistance genes and pyramiding resistance genes from different origins to increase the durability of resistance. Molecular markers closely linked to resistance genes could be helpful in molecular breeding of new resistance varieties (Tuyen et al., 2011). Several donors for resistance to L. striatellus, such as Mudgo, Rathu Heenati, Kasalath and Oryza officinalis, have been identified (Zhang et al., 2014).  Cultural Control   Modifying the sowing or transplanting times of host plants to avoid an overlap between the susceptible stage of the plant and migration of the vector can be an effective method of controlling virus diseases transmitted by L. striatellus. Following an epidemic of Rice stripe virus in Japan resulting from modification of the growing season in the 1960s, original growing practices were restored to avoid further occurrence of the virus. It was 10 years before the epidemic ceased and the proportion of infective individuals in the local population was reduced to an insignificant level (Kisimoto and Yamada, 1986). Polythene film mulching during the germination period of maize effectively suppressed the occurrence of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus by 80%, by inhibiting the vector from landing on the host plants (Kogure et al., 1968).Chemical Control The application of insecticides prior to an increase in L. striatellus nymph density can be effective in avoiding feeding damage, as nymph density relates directly to the degree of damage. The surveillance of nymph density by net sweeping is useful. Chemical control of L. striatellus as a vector of plant viruses is difficult, as infective planthoppers transmit viruses in less than a few hours. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides were widely applied to levees, roadsides and banks to control overwintering vectors during an epidemic of Rice stripe virus which occurred in western Japan during the 1960s. They were also applied to target paddies soon after transplanting to control immigrants, but the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was not inhibited (Kisimoto, 1969). L. striatellus has since become resistant to these insecticides. During an epidemic of Rice stripe virus in the 1980s, an area of 2000 ha in Gunma Prefecture, Japan was treated by three to four aerial applications of insecticides from April to July in addition to the application of granules to individual paddies to target L. striatellus, and four to five regional cooperative applications targeting all rice insect pests over 7 years. Again, the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was not significantly suppressed by these measures (Iizuka et al., 1987). Insecticide resistance Resistance of L. striatellus to insecticides was first reported by Kimura (1965). A total of 27 colonies of L. striatellus collected in Japan in 1964 showed wide variation in resistance to malathion. Highest LD50 values were 6.4 (for females) and 9.6 (for males) times as high as those of the lowest. Malathion resistance was related to the amount of malathion applied to each locality during the previous nine years since it was first applied in 1955. In 1980, topical LD50 values were determined for eight insecticides using four local populations in Kyushu, Japan, and a migrating L. striatellus colony collected over the East China Sea in 1980. The tested populations had developed 90- to 270-fold resistance to malathion as compared with a Chikugo population tested in 1967. They also showed 20- to 70-fold resistance to fenitrothion, diazinon, and some carbamates (Nagata and Ohira, 1986). Malathion resistance ratios (based on LD50) for L. striatellus colonies collected in Jinjoo and Sunsan, Korea, in 1973 ranged from 24.9 to 27.7, and from 13.8 to 18.4, respectively (Choi et al., 1975). L. striatellus resistance to carbamates was investigated and resistance to fenobucarb was 15.7-fold in a Milyang strain and resistance to fenitrothion was 48.2-fold in an Euiseong strain (Lee et al., 1987). Malathion is virtually ineffective against L. striatellus in Taiwan (Chen and Sun, 1988). A recently developed granular insecticide containing imidacloprid as an active ingredient showed durable activity in suppressing L. striatellus and other rice insect pests, when applied to seedling boxes. In certain cases, the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was suppressed to insignificant levels (Japan Plant Protection Association, 1992). Further field tests are needed to clarify the effects of this insecticide when rice stripe tenuivirus is at an epidemic level (Kisimoto and Yamada, 1998). Jin Zhong-jin and Zhou Yu-jie (2013) reported that the optimum period to spray pesticides against L. striatellus\\u00a0in rice panicle stage was within 10 days after heading when using pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Fusarium symptoms resemble those produced by S. oryzae. The Fusarium species produce oblong or irregular spots 5-20 mm long with reddish-brown margins and grey centres or they may be greyish throughout on the upper leaf sheath. Lower sheaths are also affected and superficial pink powdery growth of the fungus is visible on all the sheaths. Infection reaches the stem and causes browning and rotting of the peduncle. Panicles partially emerge or remain inside the sheath. Emerged panicles have chaffy grains or partially filled, thin grains. Fusarium equiseti and F. moniliforme [Gibberella fujikuroi] were isolated from the rice leaf sheaths. Pathogenicity tests confirmed their association with sheath rot and panicle sterility.In Colombia, Zeigler and Alvarez (1986) described the bacterial sheath brown rot caused by Pseudomonas fuscovaginae in several Latin American countries. Symptoms include 2-5 mm wide longitudinal brown necrosis of the leaf sheath, sometimes extending to its full length. In some cases, the lesions extend to the leaf margins or midrib, producing a pronounced stripe. All the leaves of a tiller may be affected. On some varieties, symptoms are more diffused, resulting in a brown to maroon blotching with no apparent leaf blade symptoms. The sheath margin often withers. When the leaf sheath is affected, water soaking may occur. Pre-emergence and post-emergence panicles from affected flag-leaf sheaths invariably show substantial glume discoloration and severely discoloured, often unfilled, grains. Panicles may not emerge completely from affected sheaths. Bacterial sheath brown rot may be easily distinguished from sheath rot by the absence of whitish powdery growth of S. oryzae on the lesions. The two diseases may occur together.\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms S. oryzae mainly attacks the uppermost leaf sheaths enclosing the young panicles. The lesions start as oblong or somewhat irregular spots 0.5-1.5 cm long, with brown margins and grey centres, or they may be greyish-brown throughout (Ou, 1985). They enlarge and often coalesce and may cover most of the leaf sheath. The young panicles remain within the sheath, do not develop further and rot, or only partial panicle emergence may be observed. Young lesions show whitish, powdery growth both outside and inside affected sheaths. Old lesions have less or no powdery growth of the fungus and appear as dry, brownish lesions with the enclosed panicle rotted. Spikelets extended outside the rotted sheath normally develop, but are usually highly discoloured (brown) and may be partially filled and infected by the pathogen.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Cyperus difformis (small-flowered nutsedge) \", \"Family\": \"Cyperaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Cyperus iria (rice flatsedge) \", \"Family\": \"Cyperaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Cyperus tenneriffae \", \"Family\": \"Cyperaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Echinochloa colona (junglerice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Eleusine coracana (finger millet) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Eleusine indica (goose grass) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Hymenachne assamica \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Leersia hexandra (southern cut grass) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Monochoria vaginalis (pickerel weed) \", \"Family\": \"Pontederiaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Wild host\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Oryza rufipogon (wild rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"    Huang et al.

Other plants that are naturally infected include Oryza rufipogon, Hymenachne assamica, Leersia hexandra and Panicum walense in Assam, India (Deka and Phookan, 1992). Some weeds in ricefields have been reported to be collateral hosts that act as a natural source of inoculum in endemic areas: Cyperus iria, C. tenneriffae, C. difformis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Eleusine indica and Monochoria vaginalis (Balakrishnan and Nair, 1981). The following weeds and wild rices reacted positively to S. oryzae infection in the greenhouse: Cloris barbata, Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colonum, E. crus-galli, E. hispidula, E. glabrescens, Ischaemum rugosum, Leptochloa chinensis, Oryza australiensis, O. brachyanta, O. minuta and Paspalidium flavidium (Chuke, 1983).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods   S. oryzae is known to be externally and internally seedborne: other sources of field inoculum such as infected straw and collateral hosts exist in endemic areas. Elimination of field inoculum has not been evaluated as a form of control against sheath rot. In pot experiments with rice plants, potassium decreased the sheath rot disease index, with a corresponding increase in grain yield, whereas an increase in nitrogen directly increased the sheath rot disease index (Jayasekhar and Prasad, 1988). Field trials using potassium applied during the stages of tillering and panicle initiation resulted in lower disease indexes and higher grain yields compared with controls. Additional foliar sprays of calcium sulphate and carbendazim at tillering and panicle initiation further improved the effects of potassium application against sheath rot (Alagarsamy and Bhaskaran, 1986). Sekhar and Prasad (1989) showed that sheath rot incidence increased significantly with increased nitrogen. The disease incidence was decreased with increase in basal application of potassium at both nitrogen levels. Time of sowing affects the disease: paddy crops sown from August to November had higher sheath rot at the time of flowering, when there was low temperature and high relative humidity (Reddy and Subbayya, 1988). Crops sown from December to May, with higher temperature and low relative humidity prevailing at the flowering stages, had low disease incidence.Host-Plant Resistance Only a few rice cultivars are resistant to sheath rot. Generally, the tall varieties are found to be moderately resistant to sheath rot as a result of a phytoalexin, momilactone (Purkayastha et al., 1983). Photoperiod-sensitive tall varieties were more resistant than photoperiod-insensitive varieties. In Tamil Nadu (India), the following rice cultivars with high resistance to sheath rot were identified: Manoharsali, RB2069- 2-6-1, RP2071-18-1-1, CR331-1-3, IR9202-21-1, RP1057-35-1-1, VRS286-4-1, VRS163-2-2-2-2, ARC14529, and IET 8584 (Lewin and Vidhyasekaran, 1987a). Lakshmanan and Velusamy (1991) identified 15 lines (IR54742) derived from Oryza officinalis as completely disease-free under natural infection, whereas only 9 exhibited high resistance under artificial methods. Other rice varieties showing resistance in India were summarized by Narain (1992) as: TCA190-1, TCA148-3, TCA-225, BPMSl, BPM-40A, Kala Namak, KSR white, Basmati 10, HAU 11-12, PAU 269-1-9-2-1, HPU 8106, and TR-B-63. Amin (1976) reported the following tall rice cultivars to be highly resistant to sheath rot: Tetep, ARC 7117, Ram Tulasi, Manoharsali, D25-4, Sigadis, SR26B, Intan, Zenith, Dissi Hatif, Raminad Str 3 and Tadukan. In Louisiana (USA), different cultivars varied in susceptibility in field surveys: Nato, Starbonnet, Nova 66, Lebonnet and Labelle had 2.3-5% infected tillers while Saturn had 16%, Vista 24%, and Bluebelle 39% infected tillers. The average percentage of infected tillers in the five parishes surveyed was 11.4% (Shahjahan et al., 1977).Biological Control Rhizobacteria of Pseudomonas fluorescens type isolated from citrus and rice were equally toxic to the rice sheath rot fungus (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1986a). Rice cultivars IR20 and IET 1444, sprayed with P. fluorescens (100,000,000 c.f.u./ml.) at the booting stage, had substantially reduced sheath rot severity and significantly increased grain yield (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1986b). Reduction in sheath rot disease index due to treatment with P. fluorescens was reported to vary from 32 to 42% in the five rice cultivars tested, with corresponding yield increases of 3-62% (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1987). One strain of P. fluorescens was identified as a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium with antibiosis against S. oryzae in vitro. After P. fluorescens treatment, rice cultivar IR50 exhibited differential growth increases: 19% growth increase with citrus strain and 27% increase with potato strain compared with control plants (Sakthivel et al. 1986). This phenomenon of growth promotion to host and reduction in the disease incidence and yield increase still has to be explored. Bipolaris zeicola [Cochliobolus carbonum], another potential antagonist of sheath rot, was isolated from the rice phylloplane (Viswanathan and Narayanasamy, 1990). It showed a clear inhibition zone with S. oryzae mycelium in agar plates. Culture filtrates of Bipolaris zeicola [Cochliobolus carbonum] completely inhibited mycelial growth of S. oryzae. Another promising development is the identification of antifungal activity of extracts from leaves and flowers of Tagetes erecta. These extracts inhibited S. oryzae mycelium by 100% and inhibited Gerlachia oryzae [Monographella albescens] by 76% (Miah et al., 1990).Chemical Control Chemical control of sheath rot has been intensively studied in India. Murty (1986) found that carbendazim and mancozeb (seed treatment and two foliar sprays around the booting stage) reduced sheath rot incidence significantly. Benomyl and copper oxychloride have also been reported to be effective in the field. However, studies by Lewin and Vidhyasekaran (1987b) indicated that all fungicides they tested (carbendazim, carboxin, copper oxychloride,\\u00a0iprobenfos, iprodione, mancozeb, tridemorph, thiophanate-methyl and validamycin) were ineffective. Effective combinations of fungicides (carbendazim) and insecticides to control sheath rot and leaf-folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Raju et al., 1988) resulted in lower incidence of sheath rot.  Neem oil-based emulsifiable concentrate formulations effectively controlled rice sheath rot and resulted to higher grain yield in five field trials (Narasimhan et al., 1998). ASD20, which was released in Tamil Nadu, India, in January 1997, is resistant to stem borer, leaf folder and sheath rot (Shanmugasundaram et al., 1997). Two sprays of either thiophanate-methyl (Das et al., 1997), carbendazim (Das et al., 1997; Dodan et al., 1996) or propiconazole (Dodan et al., 1996) were highly effective in controlling rice sheath rot and significantly increased grain yield. \\u00a0\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

For a detailed description of each of these bacterial diseases and their differentiative characteristics, refer to Cartwright et al. (2018). Furthermore, A. oryzae and A. avenae are closely related and often not easy to differentiate from each other, which can result in inaccurate identification based on traditional methods such as carbon source utilization profile, fatty acid methyl esters and ELISA detection tests (Schaad et al., 2008).\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms Symptoms of bacterial brown stripe of rice include water-soaked streaks at the leaf-sheath base, sometimes extending into the blade and becoming dark or purplish brown leading to leaf yellowing, stunting and death. Symptoms vary slightly on different parts of the plant. A detailed description of symptoms of bacterial brown stripe of rice is provided by Kadota and Ohuchi (1990).  Leaf symptoms: On leaves, symptoms include long, narrow, reddish-brown stripes that vary in length and are sharply delineated by uninfected adjacent vascular bundles.  Seedling stage: In the seedling stage, disease symptoms include inhibition of germination, brown stripe on the leaf, curving of the leaf sheath and abnormal elongation of the mesocotyl. Inhibition of germination prevails in the seeds that have started to germinate. Heavily infected seeds die without germination. If germinated, the coleoptile of approximately 1 cm growth, turns pale yellowish brown accompanied by a water-soaked region, and stops growing. If they do not die, the infected seedlings grow less than healthy ones. One side of the leaf sheath grows better than the other, resulting in the leaf sheath being curved like a bow. Growth of the seminal roots of the curved seedlings is usually retarded remarkably. Seedlings showing these symptoms usually die before the third or fourth leaf stage. Under greenhouse conditions, diseased seedlings show water-soaked areas on coleoptiles and brown stripes on leaf sheaths and midribs.  Tillering stage: Transplantation of the infected seedlings to paddy fields results in the symptoms being masked. Disease symptoms could not be seen at the tillering stage.  Panicle formation stage: Disease symptoms occur at the panicle formation stage. Water-soaked and dark-green spots are seen on the leaf sheaths of the plants. A long and slender brown stripe is seen along the midrib of the new leaves. Young unfolding leaves turn dark brown and eventually die. Elongation of the first and second internodes, curving of the rachis, reduction of rachis branches and abnormal elongation of the palea and lemma to the long axis are observed.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Oryza sativa (rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"    Schaad et al.

However, individual strains infect only one or a few host species (Kawaguchi et al., 2021). Schaad et al. (2008) noted that all strains isolated from rice were pathogenic on both rice and maize while the strains isolated from maize were pathogenic on maize but not rice. Furthermore, maize strains differed in their pathogenicity on wheat, while rice strains were not pathogenic to wheat at all. According to Baraoidan (1981), the causal agent of brown stripe of rice isolated from infected seedlings was pathogenic on rice but not to common grass weeds. A comprehensive host range test using an entire set of representative strains isolated from different poaceous plants is warranted to shed light on the natural and experimental host range of the members of A. avenae.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Control  Acidovorax oryzae is a seedborne pathogen, and infected seedlings play a pivotal role in the establishment and dissemination of the disease in rice fields. An effective method for controlling bacterial brown stripe is to maintain appropriate levels of temperature and humidity when growing rice seedlings and use healthy seeds tested for high germination before planting (Kadota and Ohuchi, 1990). Implementation of regulatory rules at the seedling transplantation stage could reduce the cost and effort needed for disease control under the field conditions. Most of the studies on the management of bacterial brown stripe of rice were conducted before the reclassification of the causal agent. Hence, the taxonomic status of the pathogen needs to be clarified by sampling and pathogen identification to ensure that a correct management strategy is being applied.   Biological Control The halotolerant species, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, exhibited strong in vitro and in vivo antagonistic activity against A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2018). However, the use of this antagonist under field conditions for the management of bacterial brown stripe has not yet been approved.   Chemical Control After reclassification of the causal agent of bacterial brown stripe of rice as A. oryzae (Schaad et al., 2008), species-specific investigations have rarely been conducted to find conventional chemicals for disease management. However, a number of novel chemicals based on nanotechnology gave promising results in vitro and under greenhouse conditions for the management of A. oryzae. Using fresh fruit extract of Phyllanthus emblica, low-cost biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was reported to combat the growth of A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2019). At 20 \\u03bcg/ml the nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against A. oryzae (Masum et al., 2019). Bioengineered chitosan-magnesium nano-composite was reported as an antimicrobial agent against A. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani [Thanatephorus cucumeris] for sustainable rice production. The chitosan-magnesium nano-composite showed antimicrobial activity against A. oryzae and significantly inhibited the growth of the pathogen as compared to a non-treated control (Ahmed et al., 2021a). Magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgONPs) produced by Acinetobacter johnsonii showed antibacterial activity against A. oryzae where substantial antibacterial activity was exhibited by the MgONPs in culture-based tests and ultrastructure studies (Ahmed et al., 2021b). Furthermore, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from pomelo (Citrus maxima) fruit extract can play an important role in controlling A. oryzae (Ali et al., 2020). Ogunyemi et al. (2019) showed that synthesized magnesium oxide (MgO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles using Matricaria chamomilla [Chamomilla recutita] extract could serve as an alternative approach for the management of A. oryzae. Three thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) analogues significantly inhibited in vitro growth of A. oryzae. The three ThDP analogues significantly reduced biofilm formation and the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase of the pathogen (Wang et al., 2019). The use of auto sprouters for propagation in rice, in which the temperature is kept at 30-32\\u00b0C under aerobic conditions, facilitates survival of the bacteria. Applications of kasugamycin to the auto sprouters during incubation may be used for control (Yaoita et al., 1988); soil applications in the nursery have given good control without any rice injury (Hiramatsu et al., 1989). The emergence of kasugamycin antibiotic-resistant A. oryzae and Burkholderia glumae, which cause rice bacterial brown stripe and rice bacterial grain and seedling rot, respectively, is a serious threat for the effective control of these diseases (Yoshii et al., 2015). Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) analogues have been designed and synthesized based on the ThDP binding site of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex E1 of Escherichia coli. The application of synthesized ThDP analogues might be a tractable strategy to overcome the pathogen of rice bacterial brown stripe (Wang et al., 2019).   Host Resistance (Incl. Vaccination) No rice cultivar has so far been reported to be resistant to A. oryzae. Sato et al. (1983) observed varietal differences in symptom expression during laboratory tests with inoculated seeds. It has been shown that expression of a bacterial flagellin gene from A. oryzae strain N1141 triggers plant immune responses and confers disease resistance in transgenic rice plants (Takakura et al., 2008). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Yellow-brown spots of varying shape were formed on leaves and sheaths after incubation they yielded C. verruculosa, this is the first report on Cynodon in China (Huang et al., 2005).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods   Various publications provide information on the impact of fertilizer (Narinder-Singh et al., 1987), soil type (Furlani et al., 1975), plant spacing (Agarwal et al., 1975) and planting time (Rush, 1973), but all of these studies relate to several pathogens that affect seed infection, including Curvularia spp.  UCIPM (2009) highlights the importance of applying the correct amount of fertiliser, reducing soil compaction, providing good soil drainange and management of the thatch layer, keeping it under 0.5 inches in thickness.Host-Plant Resistance In samples of 15 rice varieties produced in 1935 at the Rice Experiment Station, Beaumont, Texas, black kernels ranged from 0.04% in Rexoro to 1.l% in Caloro (Marchionatto and Altstat, 1940). Rice collected in 1938 from the Texas rice area indicated that Shoemed and Fortuna were more severely affected that year than Roxoro, Lady Wright, Blue Rose, Caloro, Deltius, and Early Prolific (Atkins, 1974). Nearly 7% of plants of the cultivars IR20 and TKM9 growing in experimental plots at the end of the 1990 dry season showed dark brown lesions, mostly on the sheath enclosing the young panicle. Panicles emerging from diseased plants were mostly black. The pathogen was identified as C. lunata [Cochliobolus lunatus], not previously reported as a cause of sheath rot. In inoculation tests on 23 cultivars only six remained disease-free (Lakshmanan, 1991). In field trials in 1971, 1972 and 1975, five cultivars were inoculated in the spike at the pre-emergence stage with conidia of Cochliobolus lunatus isolated from rice. None of the cultivars was resistant and incidence was high (Hermida Laffitte et al., 1980).  Audilakshmi et al. (1999) found a strong association between glume color and grain mold resistance. It has been suggested that it is possible to enhance grain mold resistance in white-grained sorghum by incorporating coloured-glume character.Chemical Control  Specific control measures are lacking for black kernel, but spraying with broad-spectrum fungicides can effectively arrest infestation over glumes and other plant parts (Misra et al., 1994b). Thiram and methoxyethyl-mercury chloride reduced the number of isolations of leaf surface fungi, but two insecticides had no significant effect. Frequency of pathogenic Curvularia spp. increased with successive applications of all chemicals. Re-colonization was more rapid on leaves treated with fungicide-insecticide combinations than with either of the chemicals alone (Kuthubutheen, 1984). Discoloration caused by Helminthosporium and Cochliobolus lunatus was controlled by applications of guazatine, IBP and mancozeb (Duraisamy,1982). Grain infection by Helminthosporium oryzae [Cochliobolus miyabeanus] and Curvularia sp., and some other pathogens in IR20 under wet field conditions, was least in plots treated with\\u00a0copper oxychloride, once at the milky stage and again one week later (Govindarajan and Kannaiyan, 1982). In soils treated with carboxin the predominant fungi were Curvularia sp., Alternaria sp. and Mycogone sp.. With the exception of Alternaria sp., Rhizopus sp. and Syncephalastrum sp., all fungi appearing in treated soils were also found in untreated soils. The changing fungal flora in treated and untreated soils are compared and tabulated (Ganesan and Lalithakumari, 1991).  Vitavax, Thiram and Mancozeb eradicated the majority of seed-borne Curvularia lunata (Huynh and Ashok, 2005).Biological Control Potential biological control agents for several seedborne pathogens of rice, including Curvularia spp., have been examined, but no control practice currently exists (Shubha et al., 1992; Manasi-Mishra et al., 1990).\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Initial symptoms often begin with the yellowing of leaf tips, which then develop into yellow to orange discolouration of the leaves. In young plants, few tillers are produced and root development is incomplete. The plants, especially the younger ones, become stunted with small panicles and often unviable, deformed seeds. Localisation of the virus in vascular tissues reduces soluble sugars and causes an increase in the starch and amino acids in the plant (Azzam and Chancellor, 2002).  The disease is sometimes difficult to detect due to the variation in symptom expression, but it can result in losses of up to 74% (Ling, 1972). Brown, irregular blotches develop on leaves, and are more common on the younger plants. Leaves may also become mottled, or have light-green to white stripes parallel to the leaf veins (Hibino, 1996). If infection occurs at a young age, shortening of the leaf blade and leaf sheath result in the stunting of the plant. Root development is poor and flower development takes longer, which delays maturity and the panicles do not develop or exsert properly. Fewer grains are produced, and those that are yielded, have a reduced weight and may be coated in brown blotches (Suparyono et al., 2012).\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Oryza sativa (rice) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}]], \"hostsOrSpeciesAffected\": \"\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

No other clearly-defined species of Alternaria-like fungus occurs on rice (Simmons, 2007). The species reported on Sorghum vulgare, Alternaria sorghicola, produces conidia from branched conidiophores, conidia in chains that have both transverse and longitudinal septa, with or without long beaks that terminate in cells that are secondary conidiophores (Simmons, 2007). A number of other fungi cause seed rot and seedling blight (Ou, 1985; Rush, 1992), sheath rot (Naeimi et al., 2003), and grain discolouration (Tullis, 1936; Padwick, 1950; Saini, 1985; Lee, 1992b) of rice.

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Prevention   SPS Measures  The testing and certification of rice seed is necessary to prevent the importation of this seedborne pathogen into new areas or the increase of inoculum in already infested areas. The fungus has been detected in seed of exotic germplasm imported to India (Agarwal et al., 2006) as well as in inert matter contaminating local seed lots in Bangladesh (Khokon et al., 2005). In New Zealand, T. padwickii was detected only in seed lots of foreign origin, not in the native ones (Lau and Sheridan, 1975).   Control   Cultural Control and Sanitary Measures  Padwick (1950) recommended destruction of rice stubble and straw by burning. A row spacing trial (15, 20, and 25 cm wide) showed that seedborne infections were highest with the closest spacing. Seed infection also increased proportionally as nitrogenous fertilizer applications were increased from 0 to 200 kg/ha (Agarwal et al., 1975).   Physical/Mechanical Control  Hand cleaning of farmers\\u2019 seed was found effective in improving seed germination and seedling vigour in Bangladesh (Mathur et al., 2004). The hot water treatment of seed is an alternative to cleaning and the use of chemicals, but may reduce the level of germination.  Tisdale (1922) found that, after a pre-soaking period of 16 hours in tepid water, soaking seed for 15 minutes in water at 54\\u00b0C gave the best results for germination and disinfection.  In India, Suryanarayan et al. (1963) recommended the use of 50\\u00b0C water for 10 minutes, but germination was reduced to 62%. Alternative variations gave improved germination, but did not completely eliminate infection.  The proper drying of the grain before storage should reduce later development of infection (Lee, 1992b).   Biological Control  A formulation of rice rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens, in powdered talc, was effective in reducing seedling infection by T. padwickii and Bipolaris oryzae when applied to seeds at the rates of 5 and 10 g per kg (Praveen Kumar et al., 2001).   Chemical Control  Several fungicide sprays gave satisfactory control of grain discolouration, including: chlorothalonil, mancozeb, carboxin, and fenapanil (Ferrer et al., 1980); polyoxin (Arunyanart et al., 1981);\\u00a0iprobenfos and benomyl (Rajan and Nair, 1979); and iprodione (Rodriguez et al., 1988).  Despite the deep-seated nature of seed infection, several seed-treatment fungicides are reported as giving control of seed infection, including\\u00a0iprobenfos and benomyl (Rajan and Nair, 1979); N-ethylmercurio-4-toluenesulfonanilide (Aleshin et al., 1980); and mancozeb (Vir et al., 1971). Seed treatment with hot water or mancozeb appears to be essential to control seedborne infection in high-yielding rice cultivars (Rath, 1974).  Chemicals from natural sources may provide control that is less toxic to mammals and less polluting in the environment. Shanmugam (2004) tested leaf extracts of twenty plant species and found that a 10% concentration of the extract of Prosopis juliflora (mesquite) had an inhibitory effect equivalent to that of a fungicide on mycelial growth and spore germination of seed-borne fungi of rice, including T. padwickii. The essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes of Curcuma longa (turmeric) are also effective against the fungus, but at higher concentrations (Behura et al., 2000). Seeking a treatment available to small farmers in Cameroon, Nguefack et al. (2008) tested the essential oils of three locally-grown plants applied as a slurry to rice seed. Those of Ocimum gratissimum (African basil) and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) had an effect similar to that of mancozeb in reducing transmission of fungi from seeds to seedlings. A natural chemical, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, isolated from the Indian plant, Decalepis hamiltonii was almost as effective as thiram as a treatment against T. padwickii and other seed-borne fungi (Devihalli Chikkaiah et al., 2009).   Host Resistance  Although Rath (1974) reported no resistance to T. padwickii in high-yielding rice cultivars, some breeding lines were found resistant in nursery tests in Java, Indonesia (Soepriaman et al., 1976). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness  T. padwickii, previously known as Alternaria padwickii, is an asexually reproducing fungus that infects seeds of rice [Oryza sativa]. It is one of several fungi responsible for seed discolouration, seed rot and seedling blight, but has also been detected as a sheath-rotting pathogen (Naeimi et al., 2003). It occurs in southern Asia and in countries on other continents worldwide, but its presence in mainland North America is not confirmed. Transport to and transmission in new areas may be prevented by use of tested clean seed. Where the pathogen is already present, application of seed treatments should reduce disease incidence, but the fungus has an undetermined ability to survive as sclerotia in plant debris and soil.\"}\n",

Macropters of these planthoppers are all active fliers and tend to disperse in early life and land on various substrates. Specimens sampled by sweeping on the target host plant may include specimens of improper species. Brachypterism in male L. striatellus is less prominent than in certain other delphacids, the wing tip reaching almost to the tip of the abdomen.

Many plant species have been incorrectly listed as host plants of L. striatellus, because the adult planthoppers actively disperse and probe their stylets on a variety of plants and substrates. Strictly, for a plant to be listed as a host of L. striatellus, the eggs and nymphs should be detected, and a substantial population of the planthoppers established, on the plant in the field. For example, maize is infected by viruses transmitted by L. striatellus but is not listed as a host plant of this species as it is unlikely that the planthoppers establish a population on maize (Conti, 1984; Harpaz, 1961).Agropyron repens, Briza spp., Bromus arvensis and Lagurus ovatus have been identified as host plants of L. striatellus in laboratory tests, but field tests are necessary to confirm whether they are host plants for this species.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Host-Plant Resistance   Resistant cultivars are recognized as the most economic and effective measure for controlling the insect. Resistant varieties are being developed by introgression of resistance genes and pyramiding resistance genes from different origins to increase the durability of resistance. Molecular markers closely linked to resistance genes could be helpful in molecular breeding of new resistance varieties (Tuyen et al., 2011). Several donors for resistance to L. striatellus, such as Mudgo, Rathu Heenati, Kasalath and Oryza officinalis, have been identified (Zhang et al., 2014).  Cultural Control   Modifying the sowing or transplanting times of host plants to avoid an overlap between the susceptible stage of the plant and migration of the vector can be an effective method of controlling virus diseases transmitted by L. striatellus. Following an epidemic of Rice stripe virus in Japan resulting from modification of the growing season in the 1960s, original growing practices were restored to avoid further occurrence of the virus. It was 10 years before the epidemic ceased and the proportion of infective individuals in the local population was reduced to an insignificant level (Kisimoto and Yamada, 1986). Polythene film mulching during the germination period of maize effectively suppressed the occurrence of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus by 80%, by inhibiting the vector from landing on the host plants (Kogure et al., 1968).Chemical Control The application of insecticides prior to an increase in L. striatellus nymph density can be effective in avoiding feeding damage, as nymph density relates directly to the degree of damage. The surveillance of nymph density by net sweeping is useful. Chemical control of L. striatellus as a vector of plant viruses is difficult, as infective planthoppers transmit viruses in less than a few hours. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides were widely applied to levees, roadsides and banks to control overwintering vectors during an epidemic of Rice stripe virus which occurred in western Japan during the 1960s. They were also applied to target paddies soon after transplanting to control immigrants, but the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was not inhibited (Kisimoto, 1969). L. striatellus has since become resistant to these insecticides. During an epidemic of Rice stripe virus in the 1980s, an area of 2000 ha in Gunma Prefecture, Japan was treated by three to four aerial applications of insecticides from April to July in addition to the application of granules to individual paddies to target L. striatellus, and four to five regional cooperative applications targeting all rice insect pests over 7 years. Again, the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was not significantly suppressed by these measures (Iizuka et al., 1987). Insecticide resistance Resistance of L. striatellus to insecticides was first reported by Kimura (1965). A total of 27 colonies of L. striatellus collected in Japan in 1964 showed wide variation in resistance to malathion. Highest LD50 values were 6.4 (for females) and 9.6 (for males) times as high as those of the lowest. Malathion resistance was related to the amount of malathion applied to each locality during the previous nine years since it was first applied in 1955. In 1980, topical LD50 values were determined for eight insecticides using four local populations in Kyushu, Japan, and a migrating L. striatellus colony collected over the East China Sea in 1980. The tested populations had developed 90- to 270-fold resistance to malathion as compared with a Chikugo population tested in 1967. They also showed 20- to 70-fold resistance to fenitrothion, diazinon, and some carbamates (Nagata and Ohira, 1986). Malathion resistance ratios (based on LD50) for L. striatellus colonies collected in Jinjoo and Sunsan, Korea, in 1973 ranged from 24.9 to 27.7, and from 13.8 to 18.4, respectively (Choi et al., 1975). L. striatellus resistance to carbamates was investigated and resistance to fenobucarb was 15.7-fold in a Milyang strain and resistance to fenitrothion was 48.2-fold in an Euiseong strain (Lee et al., 1987). Malathion is virtually ineffective against L. striatellus in Taiwan (Chen and Sun, 1988). A recently developed granular insecticide containing imidacloprid as an active ingredient showed durable activity in suppressing L. striatellus and other rice insect pests, when applied to seedling boxes. In certain cases, the occurrence of rice stripe tenuivirus was suppressed to insignificant levels (Japan Plant Protection Association, 1992). Further field tests are needed to clarify the effects of this insecticide when rice stripe tenuivirus is at an epidemic level (Kisimoto and Yamada, 1998). Jin Zhong-jin and Zhou Yu-jie (2013) reported that the optimum period to spray pesticides against L. striatellus\\u00a0in rice panicle stage was within 10 days after heading when using pymetrozine and chlorpyrifos.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Fusarium symptoms resemble those produced by S. oryzae. The Fusarium species produce oblong or irregular spots 5-20 mm long with reddish-brown margins and grey centres or they may be greyish throughout on the upper leaf sheath. Lower sheaths are also affected and superficial pink powdery growth of the fungus is visible on all the sheaths. Infection reaches the stem and causes browning and rotting of the peduncle. Panicles partially emerge or remain inside the sheath. Emerged panicles have chaffy grains or partially filled, thin grains. Fusarium equiseti and F. moniliforme [Gibberella fujikuroi] were isolated from the rice leaf sheaths. Pathogenicity tests confirmed their association with sheath rot and panicle sterility.In Colombia, Zeigler and Alvarez (1986) described the bacterial sheath brown rot caused by Pseudomonas fuscovaginae in several Latin American countries. Symptoms include 2-5 mm wide longitudinal brown necrosis of the leaf sheath, sometimes extending to its full length. In some cases, the lesions extend to the leaf margins or midrib, producing a pronounced stripe. All the leaves of a tiller may be affected. On some varieties, symptoms are more diffused, resulting in a brown to maroon blotching with no apparent leaf blade symptoms. The sheath margin often withers. When the leaf sheath is affected, water soaking may occur. Pre-emergence and post-emergence panicles from affected flag-leaf sheaths invariably show substantial glume discoloration and severely discoloured, often unfilled, grains. Panicles may not emerge completely from affected sheaths. Bacterial sheath brown rot may be easily distinguished from sheath rot by the absence of whitish powdery growth of S. oryzae on the lesions.

They enlarge and often coalesce and may cover most of the leaf sheath. The young panicles remain within the sheath, do not develop further and rot, or only partial panicle emergence may be observed. Young lesions show whitish, powdery growth both outside and inside affected sheaths. Old lesions have less or no powdery growth of the fungus and appear as dry, brownish lesions with the enclosed panicle rotted.

Some weeds in ricefields have been reported to be collateral hosts that act as a natural source of inoculum in endemic areas: Cyperus iria, C. tenneriffae, C. difformis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Eleusine indica and Monochoria vaginalis (Balakrishnan and Nair, 1981).

Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods   S. oryzae is known to be externally and internally seedborne: other sources of field inoculum such as infected straw and collateral hosts exist in endemic areas. Elimination of field inoculum has not been evaluated as a form of control against sheath rot. In pot experiments with rice plants, potassium decreased the sheath rot disease index, with a corresponding increase in grain yield, whereas an increase in nitrogen directly increased the sheath rot disease index (Jayasekhar and Prasad, 1988). Field trials using potassium applied during the stages of tillering and panicle initiation resulted in lower disease indexes and higher grain yields compared with controls. Additional foliar sprays of calcium sulphate and carbendazim at tillering and panicle initiation further improved the effects of potassium application against sheath rot (Alagarsamy and Bhaskaran, 1986). Sekhar and Prasad (1989) showed that sheath rot incidence increased significantly with increased nitrogen. The disease incidence was decreased with increase in basal application of potassium at both nitrogen levels. Time of sowing affects the disease: paddy crops sown from August to November had higher sheath rot at the time of flowering, when there was low temperature and high relative humidity (Reddy and Subbayya, 1988). Crops sown from December to May, with higher temperature and low relative humidity prevailing at the flowering stages, had low disease incidence.Host-Plant Resistance Only a few rice cultivars are resistant to sheath rot. Generally, the tall varieties are found to be moderately resistant to sheath rot as a result of a phytoalexin, momilactone (Purkayastha et al., 1983). Photoperiod-sensitive tall varieties were more resistant than photoperiod-insensitive varieties. In Tamil Nadu (India), the following rice cultivars with high resistance to sheath rot were identified: Manoharsali, RB2069- 2-6-1, RP2071-18-1-1, CR331-1-3, IR9202-21-1, RP1057-35-1-1, VRS286-4-1, VRS163-2-2-2-2, ARC14529, and IET 8584 (Lewin and Vidhyasekaran, 1987a). Lakshmanan and Velusamy (1991) identified 15 lines (IR54742) derived from Oryza officinalis as completely disease-free under natural infection, whereas only 9 exhibited high resistance under artificial methods. Other rice varieties showing resistance in India were summarized by Narain (1992) as: TCA190-1, TCA148-3, TCA-225, BPMSl, BPM-40A, Kala Namak, KSR white, Basmati 10, HAU 11-12, PAU 269-1-9-2-1, HPU 8106, and TR-B-63. Amin (1976) reported the following tall rice cultivars to be highly resistant to sheath rot: Tetep, ARC 7117, Ram Tulasi, Manoharsali, D25-4, Sigadis, SR26B, Intan, Zenith, Dissi Hatif, Raminad Str 3 and Tadukan. In Louisiana (USA), different cultivars varied in susceptibility in field surveys: Nato, Starbonnet, Nova 66, Lebonnet and Labelle had 2.3-5% infected tillers while Saturn had 16%, Vista 24%, and Bluebelle 39% infected tillers. The average percentage of infected tillers in the five parishes surveyed was 11.4% (Shahjahan et al., 1977).Biological Control Rhizobacteria of Pseudomonas fluorescens type isolated from citrus and rice were equally toxic to the rice sheath rot fungus (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1986a). Rice cultivars IR20 and IET 1444, sprayed with P. fluorescens (100,000,000 c.f.u./ml.) at the booting stage, had substantially reduced sheath rot severity and significantly increased grain yield (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1986b). Reduction in sheath rot disease index due to treatment with P. fluorescens was reported to vary from 32 to 42% in the five rice cultivars tested, with corresponding yield increases of 3-62% (Sakthivel and Gnanamanickam, 1987). One strain of P. fluorescens was identified as a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium with antibiosis against S. oryzae in vitro. After P. fluorescens treatment, rice cultivar IR50 exhibited differential growth increases: 19% growth increase with citrus strain and 27% increase with potato strain compared with control plants (Sakthivel et al. 1986). This phenomenon of growth promotion to host and reduction in the disease incidence and yield increase still has to be explored. Bipolaris zeicola [Cochliobolus carbonum], another potential antagonist of sheath rot, was isolated from the rice phylloplane (Viswanathan and Narayanasamy, 1990). It showed a clear inhibition zone with S. oryzae mycelium in agar plates. Culture filtrates of Bipolaris zeicola [Cochliobolus carbonum] completely inhibited mycelial growth of S. oryzae. Another promising development is the identification of antifungal activity of extracts from leaves and flowers of Tagetes erecta. These extracts inhibited S. oryzae mycelium by 100% and inhibited Gerlachia oryzae [Monographella albescens] by 76% (Miah et al., 1990).Chemical Control Chemical control of sheath rot has been intensively studied in India. Murty (1986) found that carbendazim and mancozeb (seed treatment and two foliar sprays around the booting stage) reduced sheath rot incidence significantly. Benomyl and copper oxychloride have also been reported to be effective in the field. However, studies by Lewin and Vidhyasekaran (1987b) indicated that all fungicides they tested (carbendazim, carboxin, copper oxychloride,\\u00a0iprobenfos, iprodione, mancozeb, tridemorph, thiophanate-methyl and validamycin) were ineffective. Effective combinations of fungicides (carbendazim) and insecticides to control sheath rot and leaf-folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Raju et al., 1988) resulted in lower incidence of sheath rot.  Neem oil-based emulsifiable concentrate formulations effectively controlled rice sheath rot and resulted to higher grain yield in five field trials (Narasimhan et al., 1998). ASD20, which was released in Tamil Nadu, India, in January 1997, is resistant to stem borer, leaf folder and sheath rot (Shanmugasundaram et al., 1997). Two sprays of either thiophanate-methyl (Das et al., 1997), carbendazim (Das et al., 1997; Dodan et al., 1996) or propiconazole (Dodan et al., 1996) were highly effective in controlling rice sheath rot and significantly increased grain yield. \\u00a0\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

Recent approaches to the taxonomy of the genus involve molecular methodologies in an attempt to more accurately characterize the many described species (Duncan et al., 1999; Orui and Mizukubo, 1999; Uehara et al., 1999).The nematodes, and the symptoms produced, are similar to those of other lesion nematodes of the genus Pratylenchus, and also those of the burrowing nematode, R. similis. Symptoms of dry rot disease in yam tubers are identical to those caused by the nematode Scutellonema bradys.\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms P. coffeae only infects the roots, tubers, corms and rhizomes of host plants but referred symptoms are produced on other parts of the plant.Bananas, Plantains and Musa textilisP. coffeae causes damage symptoms similar to those observed with other root lesion nematodes such as Radopholus similis: stunting; lengthening of the vegetative cycle; reduction in the size and number of leaves, and in bunch weight; reduction of the productive life of the plantation; toppling. Roots heavily infested by P. coffeae have extensive black or purple necrosis of epidermal and cortical tissue, often accompanied by secondary rotting and root breakage. Similar necrosis can be observed on the outer parts of the corm.YamsP. coffeae causes dry rot symptoms in yam tubers. Brown, irregular dry rot extends 1-2 cm into the outer tissues of D. rotundata tubers, but can occur as deep as 5 cm in tubers of D. alata. The dry rot can be more pronounced in the oldest apical portions of the tubers, adjacent to the vines or may even be restricted to these portions in newly harvested tubers.External symptoms on tubers of D. alata, D. cayenensis and D. rotundata are deep cracks, a corky appearance, exposed dark-brown rotted areas and diseased tubers, which are spongy to the touch. Necrosis or rotting, caused by P. coffeae, has also been observed in tubers of D. esculenta and D. trifida. Above-ground symptoms of damage are not as obvious. Vines from tubers which are severely infected with P. coffeae are unthrifty and shorter than normal plants.Using planting material with a high proportion of dry rot can result in tubers not sprouting and poor stands in yam fields (Acosta, 1974; Acosta and Ayala, 1975; Bridge and Page, 1984; Coates-Beckford and Brathwaite, 1977; Thompson et al., 1973). CoffeeCoffee roots infected by P. coffeae turn yellow, then brown and most of the lateral roots are rotten. Infected plants appear stunted and have few small, chlorotic leaves. The earliest symptoms of infection in newly transplanted trees are yellowing of the leaves, loss of young primary branches and stunting of the shoot. A gradual wilt sets in, followed by death of the whole tree. Severely infected plants may die prematurely.In the field, symptoms may occur in patches with yields reducing according to disease severity. Lesions occur on roots and, as a consequence, the whole root system is destroyed (Campos et al., 1990; Monteiro and Lordello, 1974; Whitehead, 1969).Ginger and TurmericP. coffeae causes rhizome rot and leaf yellowing of ginger, and is associated with discoloration and rotting of the rhizomes of turmeric. At the advanced stages of infection, the rhizomes of turmeric become deep-red to brown in colour, less turgid, and wrinkled with rot symptoms. Internally, affected rhizomes have dark-brown, necrotic lesions (Sarma et al., 1974; Koshy and Bridge, 1990).\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Acer (maples) \", \"Family\": \"Aceraceae\", \"Host status\": \"Unknown\", \"References\": \"    Jalalinasab and Heydari (2018)    \"}, {\"Host\": \" Aesculus chinensis \", \"Family\": \"Hippocastanaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Other\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Anacardium occidentale (cashew nut) \", \"Family\": \"Anacardiaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Habitat/association\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Araceae \", \"Family\": \"Araceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Areca catechu (betelnut palm) \", \"Family\": \"Arecaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Habitat/association\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) \", \"Family\": \"Moraceae\", \"Host status\": \"Unknown\", \"References\": \"    Lau et al.

No attempt, therefore, has been made to list all host species; the listing has been limited to the most important crops which are amongst its hosts. Hosts of the nematode include Citrus spp., vegetables, ornamental foliar plants and weeds (Edwards and Wehunt, 1973; O&amp;apos;Bannon and Esser, 1975; Das and Das, 1986).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control In yams, the use of plant material which is free of nematodes and dry rot disease is an effective means of controlling or reducing the damage caused by P. coffeae. Central or distal tuber pieces, which generally contain lowest number of P. coffeae, are recommended as propagative material. Seed tubers showing symptoms of dry rot (cracking and flaking) should not be used for planting.Any foliar material used for propagation should be completely free of P. coffeae. Yams, such as Dioscorea bulbifera and some forms of D. alata, can be readily propagated from bulbils or aerial tubers. A number of yams, such as D. alata, D. rotundata and D. dumetorum, can be produced from vine cuttings. Even true seed can be used for propagating D. rotundata.Although these methods of propagation are not a practical means of producing ware tubers, they can be used to produce nematode-free seed tubers. Producing large numbers of seed tubers from relatively few yams by growing &amp;apos;microsetts&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;minisetts&amp;apos; cut from mature tubers (IITA, 1984) effectively produces nematode-free propagation material if clean, healthy &amp;apos;mother seed yams&amp;apos; are selected (Jatala and Bridge, 1990).In bananas, planting nematode disease-free suckers is recommended. Some growers or organizations maintain &amp;apos;disease-free&amp;apos; nurseries from which new planting material, usually sword suckers, is collected. More commonly, planting material is taken from existing banana fields and these are more likely to be infested with nematodes. If the external tissue of the corm has purple or reddish-brown lesions, these, together with root stumps and adhering soil should be removed with a machete (pared) until only white corm tissue is exposed.Paring suckers should take place away from the field, and corms with severe lesions should be discarded. Although useful, the paring technique may never be totally effective in removing all nematode infection; this treatment is often complemented by dipping suckers in a nematicidal solution or, more effectively, by coating them with a nematicidal mud.In C\\u00f4te d&amp;apos;Ivoire, it is recommended practice to store large corms in the sun for 2 weeks prior to planting; populations of Radopholus similis in the corm tissue can decline by as much as 80%. The most reliable means of avoiding the introduction of the nematode is to use completely nematode-free banana plantlets grown from meristem cultures (Qu\\u00e9n\\u00e9herv\\u00e9 and Cadet, 1985; Gowen and Qu\\u00e9n\\u00e9herv\\u00e9, 1990).   Hot-Water Treatment BananasThe immersion of banana suckers in water held at a constant 55\\u00b0C for periods of 15-25 minutes has been a commercial practice in Australia and Central and South America (Stover, 1972). However, the technique is difficult to manage because of the critical balance that is required to achieve a temperature that is lethal to nematodes in the corm tissue but does not cause permanent damage to the plant. This factor can also be important if suckers are not of uniform size.YamsIn yam tubers, theoretical, but not always practical, control of P. coffeae can be achieved by hot water treatment. The immersion of tubers in hot water can reduce tuber populations of P. coffeae considerably, but rarely eliminates them without damage to the tuber.Hot water at 46-52\\u00b0C for 15-30 minutes is recommended for control of P. coffeae in D. rotundata tubers. The use of seed tubers with extreme dry rot should be avoided as treatment of these tubers is less effective. Treatments in water at 51\\u00b0C for 15-45 minutes also effectively suppresses populations of P. coffeae and dry rot in D. rotundata tubers, and also increases vine growth. However, hot water treatment can cause severe physiological damage (Acosta and Ayala, 1976; Coates-Beckford and Brathwaite, 1977; Thompson et al., 1973).   Chemical Control Nematicides are widely used by commercial banana growers producing fruit for the international export trade. Less specialized production, serving local markets, may not justify the high cost of chemical treatment. A number of organophosphate, oxime carbamate and carbamate nematicides are used on bananas either as granular or emulsifiable concentrate formulations.Nematicides have been successfully used to control P. coffeae in coffee nurseries in Central America. Effective control of P. coffeae can be achieved with organocarbamate and organophosphate nematicides under field conditions.   Resistant Varieties Increasing work is being done on assessing varietal resistance to P. coffeae. Price et al. (1996) reviewed techniques for field screening of Musa germplasm. Binks and Gowen (1996) also did field evaluation of Musa germplasm against P. coffeae and Radopholus similis. Banana cultivars were screened by Collingborn and Gowen (1997), the varieties Kunnan and Paka being considered highly resistant whereas Pisang Sipulu, Pisang Tongat and Pisang Mas were not considered to be resistant to the nematode.

The causal agent of Phaeoseptoria leaf spot can be distinguished from those causing eumusae leaf spot, Sigatoka and black leaf streak because Phaeoseptoria musae forms conidia in pycnidial conidiomata whereas M. eumusae, M. musicola and M. fijiensis form conidia borne on conidiophores on sporodochia. However, M. eumusae can give the impression that conidia form in pycnidia (Carlier et al., 2000a, b; Crous and Mourichon, 2002) so care must be taken in the identification. The presence of scars on conidia and conidiophores is a feature that can be used to separate M. fijiensis from M. eumusae and M. musicola.\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms Symptoms are first visible as faint, minute, reddish-brown specks on the lower surface of the leaf. Specks elongate, becoming slightly wider, to form a characteristic narrow, reddish-brown streak with dimensions of 20 x 2 mm with the long axis parallel to leaf veins. Streaks frequently overlap to form compound streaks. The colour of streaks, which are now clearly visible on the upper leaf surface, changes to dark brown, almost black. The entire leaf can blacken at this stage if streaks are numerous. If less densely congregated, streaks broaden and become fusiform or elliptical spots. Water-soaked borders appear around spots and surrounding leaf tissue yellows slightly. The centres of spots become slightly depressed and dry out, becoming light grey or buff. Each spot has a well-defined, narrow dark brown or black border and surrounding tissue is often yellow. Whole sections of leaves can become necrotic as spots coalesce. After the leaf has withered, spots remain visible because of their light-coloured centres. Different stages of disease development have been identified (Meredith and Lawrence 1969; Four\\u00e9, 1987). Often, all stages of disease development can be seen on one leaf.If inoculum pressure is high, leaves are rapidly destroyed. Often, fewer than six living leaves may be seen on a susceptible plant that is growing vegetatively. On resistant cultivars, symptoms are only usually seen on the older, lower leaves. The disease is more severe on plants with bunches because new leaves are no longer being produced to replace those lost due to disease. If disease pressure is great, it is not uncommon for a susceptible cultivar to have no viable leaves at harvest.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Digitaria (crabgrass) \", \"Family\": \"Poaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Unknown\", \"References\": \"    V\\u00e1zquez-Eu\\u00e1n et al.

Banana cultivars differ in their reaction to the pathogen. Many are susceptible, but some show varying degrees of resistance from slow lesion development to a hypersensitive-like response to infection (see Biology and Ecology). Most wild species that have been tested are infected, but invasion is usually halted at a very early stage in a hypersensitive-like response (Carlier et al., 2000a).\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control Removal and destruction of diseased leaves will reduce inoculum levels. If diseased leaves cannot be removed from the plot and burnt, they should be cut from plants and stacked on top of one another. This will prevent ascospores discharging effectively from the lower leaves in the pile. Overhead irrigation encourages disease and under-canopy micro-irrigation is preferable. Plants are also more prone to black leaf streak in sheltered areas where humidity levels are high. Good drainage systems that take surface water rapidly out of plantations can reduce humidity levels.   Host-Plant Resistance Genetic resistance to\\u00a0black leaf streak is clearly the best long-term goal for disease control, especially for smallholders who cannot afford to purchase chemicals. Cultivars with high levels of resistance include 'Yangambi Km 5' (AAA), 'Mysore' (AAB), 'Pelipita' (ABB), 'Saba' (ABB) and 'Pisang Awak' (ABB). However, these do not suit all local tastes and some are susceptible to Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense). Conventional banana breeding programmes utilize resistance to black leaf streak found in wild species of Musa, notably M. acuminata subsp. burmanicca, subsp. malaccensis and subsp. siamea, and in diploid cultivars such as 'Paka' (AA) and 'Pisang Lilin' (AA). Although a black leaf streak-resistant Cavendish-type dessert banana useful for the export trades has still to be developed, progress has been made towards breeding banana hybrids for local consumption. Plantain hybrids with good resistance have been bred by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria, and by the Fundaci\\u00f3n Hondure\\u00f1a de Investigaci\\u00f3n Agricola (FHIA), Honduras. FHIA has also bred resistant dessert bananas hybrids which have fruit of a subacid or apple flavour and resistant robust cooking banana hybrids. Other breeding programmes include the Centre de coop\\u00e9ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d\\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD) in Guadeloupe and the Centre de recherches sur bananiers et plantains (CARBAP) in Cameroon Biotechnological techniques, such as exploiting somaclonal variation, gamma irradiation and genetic engineering, are also being utilised in attempts to produce banana cultivars resistant to black leaf streak (Jones et al., 2000).   Chemical Control The disease can be controlled by the application of systemic fungicides such as benzimidazoles (benomyl, carbendazim), morpholines (tridemorph), triazoles (difenoconazole, propiconazole, triadimenol, flusilazole, fenbuconazole, bitertanol, tebuconazole, hexaconazole and cyproconazole) and strobulins (azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin). Protectant fungicides, such as dithiocarbamates (mancozeb in oil or oil-water emulsions) and chlorothalonil in water, can also control the disease during periods of low inoculum pressure. (Carlier et al., 2000; Marin et al., 2003). In countries where disease pressure is high, fungicide sprays need to be applied at very regular intervals for control to be effective. The cultivation of banana for export in Central America has become a chemical intensive industry and the cost of black leaf streak control is high (see Economic Impact).Resistance to benomyl (Stover 1980a; Fullerton and Tracy, 1984), propiconazole (Romero and Sutton, 1997) and oxystrobin has been reported. Strategies to combat this problem, such as alternating triazoles and morpholines, which have different modes of action, and the application of systemics in mixtures with protectants, have been developed (Carlier et al., 2000a; Marin et al., 2003).There are concerns that the high use of fungicides in export industries is polluting the environment. Although the number of sprays can be significantly reduced in some countries when used in conjunction with disease prediction systems, this method has not been successful in Central America (Carlier et al., 2000a; Marin et al., 2003).   Biological Control No biological control methodshave been adopted in commercial plantations. Some bacteria have shown promise, but the challenge of controlling this polycyclic fungus by biological methods is immense (Marin et al., 2003). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",

However, X. campestris pv. musacearum is known only from Ethiopia and recently from Uganda and the Republic of Congo, and there are no reliable reports of the other bacterial vascular diseases of banana or enset in Africa. Where a definitive diagnosis is required, these bacterial pathogens can be readily cultured and distinguished on the basis of the bacteriological characteristics described in the section on Morphology and elsewhere in this Compendium. Greater practical difficulty for field diagnosis arises from confusion with fusarium wilt (Panama disease), especially where flowers and fruits are not present. Yellow discoloration and wilting of older leaves, and wilting of young suckers may occur and in extreme cases fruit bunches may cease to develop and become desiccated and shrivelled. Vascular discoloration (streaking) may also be seen in Panama disease but, in contrast to banana xanthomonas wilt, this is usually most pronounced in the outer margins of older leaf sheaths of the pseudostem and not in the flower stem or floral raceme. Other distinguishing features of Panama disease are the absence of bacterial oozing from cut tissues, the presence of a general yellowish discoloration of parenchymatous tissues and a musty smell at the base of the pseudostem and in the corm. Furthermore, Fusarium wilt is mainly a problem in varieties with known susceptibility (typically Gros Michel), whereas banana xanthomonas wilt affects all cultivars including East African Highland types that are not susceptible to strains of Fusarium wilt present in Uganda (Tushemereirwe et al., 2003).\", \"symptoms\": \"Symptoms The generalised symptoms in vegetative parts of enset and banana are similar but the sequence of symptom development varies, probably according to the route of infection. Under cultivation, enset is not normally allowed to flower, being harvested for its starchy pseudostem before emergence of the floral raceme, and hence the floral symptoms do not appear to have been reported. In the leaves, the earliest symptoms are usually loss of turgor and wilting in the spear (youngest emerging leaf) or one or more of the young leaves, sometimes preceded by yellowing and distortion, especially in young plants. Older leaves often develop a pronounced yellowing, followed by wilting, necrosis and breakage of leaf bases owing to loss of turgor. Internally, vascular bundles show a cream, yellow or pinkish discoloration that may extend throughout the plant but is often most pronounced in the floral raceme. Droplets of cream to pale yellow bacterial ooze emerge slowly at first from cut tissues and cut pseudostems may yield copious quantities of ooze over a period of several days. Although the symptoms are characteristic of a vascular wilt, the bacterium does not remain confined to the vascular tissues; the large air spaces within the leaf bases may become filled with pockets of cream to pale yellow ooze and this characteristic feature appears to distinguish Xanthomonas wilt from other bacterial wilts of banana. In banana, infection of the corm may spread into daughter suckers, or in enset into plantlets induced by the removal of the vegetative meristem (enset does not normally produce suckers). Such seed pieces or plantlets from infected plants may show no visible signs of infection and can serve as sources of infection to spread the disease.Symptoms in flowers and fruits are similar to those observed in other bacterial wilts of banana (Eden-Green, 2004a, b) and serve to distinguish these diseases from other conditions, such as Fusarium wilt (Panama disease). The sequence of symptom development probably depends on the mode of infection and the variety affected, but includes the following: blackening and shrivelling of part or whole of the flowers and developing fruit bunch, usually commencing with the male flowers and affecting the whole of the male bud; discoloration, ranging from pale yellow to reddish-brown, of vascular bundles of the flower stalk and the production of droplets of bacterial ooze; internal greyish-brown discoloration of the flesh of immature fruits; and premature ripening and sometimes distortion or abnormal development of individual fruits, although in many cases the whole bunch may appear outwardly normal. As in other bacterial wilts of banana, these symptoms, together with the rapid spread of disease, are consistent with infection of inflorescences and transmission of bacteria by insects visiting the flowers (Buddenhagen and Elsasser, 1962). Furthermore, the 'Bluggoe' (ABB) cooking banana variety that is known to be particularly susceptible to insect transmission of Moko, Bugtok and Blood diseases (see elsewhere in this Compendium) is also frequently the first variety to be affected as Xanthomonas wilt spreads into new areas.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Ensete \", \"Family\": \"\", \"Host status\": \"Unknown\", \"References\": \"    Alemayehu et al.

In 2001, it was found causing disease in several cultivated varieties of banana (Musa AAA, AAB, ABB genotypes) in central Uganda (Mukuno and Kayunga districts; ASARECA, 2002; Tushemereirwe et al., 2003) where it has since assumed epidemic proportions.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Phytosanitary Measures Ideally, the movement of all parts of banana, enset and other Musaceous hosts (except as pathogen-free axenic tissue cultures) should be restricted from disease-affected areas, both within and between countries at risk from the disease. All fruits from disease-affected areas should be consumed or processed locally to minimise the risks of spread; fruit bunches that show premature ripening or other external symptoms are unlikely to enter trade but bunches that appear externally normal but are then found to be discoloured when cut open are a particular risk: these may be traded, discarded and serve as possible sources of infection. In practice it is rarely possible to enforce such controls and increased surveillance, backed by immediate eradication and phytosanitary measures, should be instigated in areas where introduction of the disease could cause economic loss.   Cultural Control and Sanitary Methods In Uganda, efforts to eradicate the disease by poisoning, uprooting and burying affected and apparently healthy plants in the original outbreak areas failed to prevent subsequent outbreaks of disease in neighbouring villages, probably because spread had already occurred. There is evidence that these initial phytosanitary operations reduced the incidence and subsequent rate of spread within the original outbreak areas. Practices to prevent inflorescence infection is likely to be at least partially efficacious. Removal of the unopened male flower buds (debudding) is effective for Moko control and is routinely practised under plantation conditions where there is a risk of infection; however, the value of this practice has been questioned for Bugtok and Blood diseases where it is thought that infection may also occur via the female flowers (Thwaites et al., 2000). Bagging whole inflorescences has been advocated for Bugtok disease (Soguilon et al., 1995).   Host-Plant Resistance Cultivars (clones) of enset have been reported that appear to be tolerant following artificial inoculation with X. campestris pv. musacearum and to recover from natural infections in the field, and these have been recommended for planting in disease-affected areas (Thwaites et al., 2000). At present there is no information concerning the response of banana cultivars to experimental inoculation with X. campestris pv. musacearum; all of the cultivars that are commonly grown in Uganda are susceptible to natural infection.   Biological Control Not known. Control of insect vectors may prove possible once these have been identified.   Chemical Control None known. Conventional antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracyclines) have been used to manage plant diseases caused by prokaryotes but these are rarely cost-effective.   Early Warning Systems Seasonal, or other predisposing factors that could be used to predict disease spread have so far not been identified for banana xanthomonas wilt.   Field Monitoring/Economic Threshold Levels Effective control of disease spread may lie in early eradication of new infection foci and, in particular, through efforts to prevent transmission of the pathogen from diseased to healthy inflorescences. Efficient surveillance and reporting is essential, backed by a rapid response both within and in advance of new outbreaks of disease.   IPM Programmes No information as yet. However, disease control is likely to be achieved through a combination of cultural and vector management practices (Eden-Green, 2004b). \", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"Summary of Invasiveness The potential threat of X. campestris pv. musacearum to banana has been recognized since the first identification of enset wilt in Ethiopia some 35 years ago and subsequent recognition that natural infections of banana occur in that country. This threat has been realised and the disease now poses one of the most serious threats to banana cultivation in East Africa and beyond.What makes the situation particularly serious, and could not have been anticipated from previous reports, is the rapid rate and expansive mode of spread in banana, apparently owing to the ease with which the pathogen is transmitted by insects visiting inflorescences. So far, no resistance to the disease had been observed in any of the commonly grown banana varieties in Uganda and in some affected areas villages have experienced a total loss of production. As with other bacterial diseases of banana, it is likely that some types, notably Bluggoe, are more susceptible to insect transmission than others. Prevention of insect transmission in this and other varieties may provide a means of reducing disease spread.\"}\n",

In C. sordidus the head is subquadrate in outline when viewed anteriorly, whereas it is elongate oval in T. nigroplagiata. In C. sordidus the anterior margin of the labrum is more pointed than in T. nigroplagiata in which the margin is straight. In C. sordidus the spiracles are simple, whereas in T. nigroplagiata they have a partial septum. Moreover, in C. sordidus the anterior seven pairs of abdominal spiracles are rudimentary and not easily seen laterally, whereas in T. nigroplagiata they are well developed and easily seen laterally.

Larval tunnels may run for the entire length of fallen pseudostems (Kalshoven, 1981).Larvae tunnelling in the corm and rootstock do the most harm. Rotting occurs through fungal decay in thoroughly riddled corms which are reduced to a blackened mass of tissue and the leaves die prematurely. The boring, if severe, so weakens the plant that it is easily knocked or blown over. Injury to the corm can interfere with root initiation and sap flow within the plant (Wright, 1976)Infested plants have dull yellow green and floppy foliage. Young infested suckers often wither and fail to develop. In a high wind more than average numbers of plants blow down, at times with severe losses.The young suckers attacked by the borers wither and die very quickly because of larval feeding and tunnelling between the lateral roots and the corm. An indication that a young plant is infested is the withering and drying of the curled roll of unopened leaves or growing part of the plant (Zimmerman, 1968a).The older plants infested by the weevil appear tall and spindly and no doubt succeeded in growing as much as they did due to the presence of numerous lateral roots surrounding the bulbs of the plants and because the attacks of the insects had been gradual (Zimmerman, 1968a).In northern Tanzania, the most obvious symptoms of damage observed were toppling, snapping, splitting, leaning, stunting and reduced fruit size, in that order (Reddy, 1988a). Observed weevil damage was snapping (in 27% of plants) and stunting (in 20%).In the Philippines, the presence of banana weevil infestation is said to be associated with bacterial rhizome head rot, caused by Erwinia carotovora (Juan, 1977), as well as in Honduras (Hord and Flippen, 1953). However, subsequent studies by Hord and Flippen (1956) showed this to be untrue.In Kerala, India in August 1984, larvae of C. sordidus are reported to have damaged the internal tissues of a banana peduncle (Charles et al., 1986), but these larvae could have been those of Odoiporus longicollis.\", \"hostPlants\": [[{\"Host\": \" Ensete ventricosum (Abyssinian banana) \", \"Family\": \"Musaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"\"}, {\"Host\": \" Musa (banana) \", \"Family\": \"Musaceae\", \"Host status\": \"Main\", \"References\": \"    Ogenga-Latigo and Masanza (1996)     Okech et al.

Other reports are unconfirmed; for example, there is an unconfirmed record from sugarcane in New South Wales, Australia (Hely et al., 1982).It attacks all stages of host plant, including cut or standing crop residues. In some banana clones, including Kisubi (AB) in Uganda (Gold and Bagabe, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, personal communication, 1998) and Pisang Awak (ABB) in Indonesia (Gold, Abera and Hasyim, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, personal communication), it prefers prostrate residues to standing plants. Cut rhizomes are especially attractive to banana weevils. Thus, detached suckers, used as planting material may be especially vulnerable to attack. Abera et al. (1999) found greater oviposition on flowering plants, whereas Mesquita and Caldas (1986) found greater survivorship of larvae on younger plants.Eggs tend to be oviposited in pseudostem and, secondarily, on rhizome, whereas eggs are rarely placed on roots (Abera et al., 1999). Attacks most commonly the corm and also the stem and pseudostem of growing plants of all stages. Larvae can move from mother to daughter plants (for example, suckers). Weevil feeding on rhizome surfaces may detach roots and internal damage may affect root initation. Direct attack on roots seems unlikely.\", \"preventionAndControl\": \"Prevention and Control  Due to the variable regulations around (de)registration of pesticides, your national list of registered pesticides or relevant authority should be consulted to determine which products are legally allowed for use in your country when considering chemical control. Pesticides should always be used in a lawful manner, consistent with the product's label.   Cultural Control   Harvesting by cutting pseudostems at random out of the stools results in cut stumps and rhizomes which provide ample material for further infestation. Harvesting of all mature pseudostems at certain intervals, rather than continually, is suggested as a preventive measure of control. This discourages the continuous breeding of the weevil, as then there will be periods in which few young suckers are present. It is also necessary to destroy stumps of wind-damaged plants (Kalshoven, 1981). The borers' affinity for freshly cut rhizome is used in surveys of adult weevil populations. At Ungoye, Kenya, Reddy (1988a) used split pseudostem traps and disc-on-stump traps, and the weevils were hand collected from them. The disc-on-stump traps were more attractive, with a maximum of 50 adult C. sordidus and 134 adult Temnoschoita nigroplagiata caught per week, as against 42 and 82, respectively, in split-pseudostem traps. Reddy (1989) stated that continuous trapping over one year reduced the population of weevils by 50%. However, trapping is not normally an effective control and has been replaced by insecticides applied to the base of the plant (See also section on Trapping, and Stover and Simmonds, 1987). In Honduras, over one million borers were collected and destroyed during a 2-year experiment but as many borers were collected during the last month as during the first. Thus trapping does not appear to be an effective control. Planting infected rhizomes increases the damage. It is most important to use vigorous uninfested planting material under good planting conditions. Planting material should be obtained from plantations free of weevils and examined carefully by taking one or two slices from it. If larvae, pupae or tunnels are present, the material must be destroyed (Treverrow, 1983). Peeling the rhizomes free of lesions and immersing in hot water at 54\\u00b0C for 10 minutes, as recommended for nematode control, is practical and effective (Stover and Simmonds, 1987). Then plant them as soon as possible in a new plantation. They should not be left overnight in heaps in the old plantation, where they could be infected with weevils' eggs.Froggatt (1928) and Sein (1934) were the first to recommend paring and heat sterilization. Paring allows for superficial inspection of the rhizome surface and rejection of suckers containing weevil damage. However, significant internal damage may be present on suckers in which the rhizome displays little evidence of attack (Ogenga-Latigo and Bakyalire, 1993). Paring and removal of outer leaf sheaths also removes most weevil eggs and nematodes (for example, Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus spp. (Gold et al., 1998 a,b)). Hot water treatment kills remaining eggs and a high percentage of larvae. For example, Gettman et al. (1992) reported greater than 99% mortality of weevil eggs and larvae when suckers of dessert bananas were placed in a water bath of 43\\u00b0C for 3 h. Immersing suckers in hot water baths of 54\\u00b0C for 20 min has been demonstrated to be very effective at eliminating nematode species and has been recommended for banana weevil control. Seshu Reddy et al. (1998) have developed a simple method for farmers to control temperature by tying wood to wax with a melting point of 55\\u00b0C. Banana weevils are attracted to cut rhizomes, so clean planting propagules should be planted before they are reinfested. Clean planting material will be most effective in the planting of new stands. Otherwise, weevils from nearby mats will quickly attack cleaned material. It is advisable not to replant previously infested areas while old corms remain in the ground. Various methods are used for destruction of the corms and it could take up to 2 years to remove all of them. Maintain a cover crop on the land during this period, to minimize soil erosion. After removing all corms allow 3 months for the infestation to die out, before replanting (Treverrow, 1983). Weevil numbers may be kept low by digging out and removing old corms, trash and other materials in which weevils may breed. Desucker and remove water suckers regularly and keep the plantation free of weeds at all times. As soon as the bunch is harvested, cut down the spent pseudostem close to the ground. Cut it into lengths of up to 60 cm and split each along its length. These cut lengths act as egg-laying traps to which weevils are attracted for shelter and feed, and to lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, the life cycle cannot continue as the cut pieces dry out and the larvae die from desiccation (Treverrow, 1983). This method of control, called 'count, cut and dry' was also advocated by Peasley and Treverrow (1984). The impact of predators on larval populations of C. sordidus could be increased by applying deep cuts to the residual stumps directly after the harvest of the bunch, thus enabling the predators to penetrate the stumps earlier and giving them additional breeding sites (Koppenh\\u00f6fer and Schmutterer, 1993). Good husbandry practices, such as clean weeding, manuring and mulching produce vigorous banana plants which have improved weevil tolerance (PANS, 1977). The use of clean planting stock, rigid sanitation, strict quarantine measures and meticulous cultural methods are universally advocated to reduce the pest status of C. sordidus. Villagers adopting the traditional method of shifting cultivation generally suffer little loss from this pest.Biological Control Possibilities and considerations for classical biological control of banana weevil have been reviewed by Greathead (1986), Greathead et al. (1986), Waterhouse and Norris (1987), Neuenschwander (1988), Kermarrec et al. (1993) and Koppenhofer (1993b,c); Schmitt (1993) provides a partial list of arthropod natural enemies. Approaches include the use of endemics, exotics (classical biological control), secondary host association and microbial control. Based on the weevil's biology, Greathead et al. (1986) gave a ca 30% chance for complete success in biological control programmes. Koppenh\\u00f6fer (1993a,b) studied endemic, opportunistic predators (histerids, hydrophilids, staphyinids and Dermaptera) of banana weevils in Kenya. Several species lowered weevil numbers in drum experiments. In Fiji, C. sordidus became a very destructive pest of bananas following its introduction in about 1901 and this led to the first attempt at its biological control. The introduction of Plaesius javanus in 1918 led to its establishment (Veitch, 1926; Bennett et al., 1976). Simmonds (1935) reported a marked reduction in weevil damage, but Pemberton (1954) considered that only partial control had been achieved. It is now known that, in addition to P. javanus, the similar P. laevigatus was also introduced (Walker and Deitz, 1979). P. javanus was released in Queensland (Australia) from 1921 to 1928 but established only briefly and establishment in New South Wales, Australia during later years failed. However, Wilson (1960) reported that Dactylosternum hydrophiloides, liberated in 1939 became established, but had only a minor controlling influence. P. javanus and P. laevigatus established in the Cook Islands after release from 1937 to 1940 but the banana weevil borer is still an important problem there (Walker and Dietz, 1979). P. javanus established in Chiapas, Mexico and was confirmed in 1973, 1984 and 1992, some 40 years after its release (Barrera and Jimenez-Jimenez, 1994). According to Waterhouse and Norris (1987), though weevils as a group seem to be poor candidates for biological control, the establishment of P. javanus and P. laevigatus in Fiji appears to have reduced the pest status of C. sordidus there. Introductions of P. javanus have resulted in successful establishment in French Polynesia, Jamaica, Marianas, New Caledonia, Western Samoa and Trinidad, but no information is available on the effects it has produced. Two other predators have been established, one in Australia and two in Jamaica (Dactylosternum hydrophiloides and D. abdominale) (Edwards, 1942) and one (Hololepta quadridentata) in St Vincent (Bennett et al., 1976) but apparently without much effect. Results were uncertain even when predators became established; they are not specific predators on the banana weevil and as weevil tunnels do not extend to the outside of the plant, the efficiency of predators on root borer larvae and pupae is much reduced (Cuill\\u00e9, 1950). Although several beetle predators have established successfully in a number of instances, no significant reductions of the pest have been achieved (Koppenh\\u00f6fer and Schmutterer, 1993). A major reason for some of these failures might have been that the pest's biology was not taken into consideration sufficiently, and neither the biology of the predators, nor their quantitative impact had been studied. In greenhouse trials, the nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae, S. glaseri and S. bibionis reduced the number of tunnels made by larvae in plantain corms at rates of 400, 4000 and 40,000 nematodes per 4-month-old plant. At the higher two rates, the nematodes caused 100% larval mortality (Figueroa, 1990). Two large-scale field trials in New South Wales, Australia using the nematodes S. carpocapsae All and S. carpocapsae NC513 gave acceptable levels of larval C. sordidus control (Treverrow et al., 1991). In Cuba, the fungus Beauveria bassiana is believed by the Cubans to be effective against C. sordidus (D. Greathead, Centre for Population Biology, Ascot, UK, personal communication, 1996). According to Koppenh\\u00f6fer and Schmutterer (1993), fungi have shown useful efficacy as control agents of this pest and might become substitutes for insecticides in the future (Delattre and Jean-Bart, 1978; Castineiras et al., 1991). However, in many tropical countries where bananas are an important staple food, distribution and application of biocontrol agents are still restricted by lack of facilities. They are also too expensive for the resource-limited subsistence farmers who represent the majority of the banana producers. Researchers in Cuba have also reported successful control of banana weevil using the ants Tetramorium guineense and Pheidole megacephala in combination with B. bassiana (Roche, 1975; Roche and Abreu, 1983; Castineiras et al., 1991). Although the ants are generalists, high populations in banana stands make them formidable predators. The ants will enter crop residues and living plants in search of weevil immatures. The introduction of antagonists in classical biological control and augmentation is more feasible than periodic releases as a sustainable solution to crop pest problems in developing countries (Yaninek and Herren, 1989), although they may not be as effective as pesticides or formulations of pathogens. Therefore in spite of previous failures, further searches for effective natural enemies should be conducted, especially in the Indo-Malaysian region. At the same time, indigenous natural enemies should be studied in areas more recently infested with C. sordidus, since it is possible that they may have escaped attention by occurring only locally, their potential impact may have been hampered by suppression from insecticides or interference with cultural practices, and some might still be adapting to their new host (Neuenschwander, 1988).Host-Plant ResistanceFogain and Price (1994) field tested a total of 52 varieties of Musa for C. sordidus damage by assessing the corm for galleries. Of the varieties tested, AAB plantains as a group showed the highest susceptibility, while AAA bananas generally escaped attack. In South Nyanza, Kenya, Speijer et al. (1993) showed that damage caused by C. sordidus was higher on a plantain used for roasting (cv. Gonja) and on an East African Highland cooking banana (cv. Lusumba) than on sweet and multi-purpose cultivars. These two studies highlight the possibility that resistant varieties could be developed. (See also Seshu Reddy and Lubega, 1993; Speijer et al., 1993; Fogain and Price, 1994; Gold et al., 1994; Musabymana, 1995; Ortiz et al., 1995; Pavis and Lemaire, 1996; Abera et al., 1997). The most important resistance mechanism appears to be antibiosis. In a study comparing six clones (Pisang awak, three highland cooking and two highland brewing banana clones) Abera et al. (1997) found little difference in host-plant attraction (based on trap catches at the base of mats) or acceptance (number of eggs per plant), but found large differences in larval survivorship indices.Chemical Control Cosmopolites frequently warrants chemical control (Ostmark, 1974). However, in almost all the plantations in Central America insecticides for borer control have not been applied for many years (Stover and Simmonds, 1987). Insecticides to combat the adults are applied to the bases of the plants, including the suckers, and the surrounding soil surface for a distance of 30 cm around the plants, using knapsack sprayers, high volume spraying units or by sprinkling as dusts. In Australia, treatment is best done from September to November and from March to May (Treverrow, 1983). In Tonga, planting material is dipped in suitable insecticides or granules applied two or three times a year which provides good control of C. sordidus (Waterhouse and Norris, 1987). In Puerto Rico two nematicides controlled the borer in plantains (Roman, 1983). When choosing which insecticide to use, farmers must abide by local regulations and those of any country to which they may wish to export their fruit. In some countries persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons are banned and moreover, the weevil is developing resistance to these in some areas. Government restrictions and resistance build-up to such insecticides has increased the use of newer organophosphates. Collins et al. (1991) has provided an overview of insecticide resistance to banana weevil. Such resistance has been documented in Australia (Swain and Corcoran, 1980; Collins et al., 1991), Africa (Bujulu et al., 1986) and Latin America (Mello et al., 1979) for a range of chemicals including cyclodienes (BHC) and\\u00a0organophosphates (chlorpyrifos,\\u00a0pirimiphos-ethyl and prothiophos). Cross-resistance has also been demonstrated (Collins et al., 1991). According to Ostmark (1974), determining the economic threshold of banana weevil populations, combined with an accurate survey method and a soil insecticide programme, would give practical control.Trapping and Pheromonal Control Trapping may be used as a means of monitoring weevil numbers (Delattre, 1980; Cardenas and Arango, 1987), establishing action thresholds (Mitchell, 1978), controlling weevils (Seshu Reddy et al., 1993, Bosch et al., 1996), and/or providing a delivery system for entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes (Castineiras et al., 1991; Treverrow, 1994). Trapping uses crop residues that attract adult weevils. Disk-on-stump traps are comprised of corm slices or leaves placed on top of harvested plants cut at the rhizome. Alternatively, harvested pseudostems are cut into 15-60 cm lengths, split in half longitudinally and placed face down on the soil. Rhizome material is more attractive to weevils (Castrillon, 1991) and disk on stump traps collect 3-7 times as many weevils as pseudostem traps (Yaringamo and van der Meer, 1976; Nanne and Klink, 1975; Mitchell 1980; Cardenas and Arango, 1986). In Uganda, trap catches are greater in the rainy seasons. Trapping to control banana weevil has been recommended for at least 70 years (Pinto, 1928). Weevil reductions due to trapping have been reported by Vilardebo (1950), Arleu et al. (1984), Koppenhofer et al. (1994), Seshu Reddy et al. (1995) and Masansa (1995). Nevertheless, the use of trapping as a banana weevil control has been controversial (INIBAP 1988; Gold and Gemmel, 1993; Gowen, 1995) and controlled studies have been limited. In a 1-year farmer participatory research study, weevil populations declined by 62% in researcher-managed fields (1 trap/mat/month), by 42% in farmer managed fields (0.3-0.6 traps/mat/month) and by 14% in controls (no trapping). Nevertheless, effects on individual farms were highly variable with trapping having no effect in some fields. Moreover, farmers felt that trapping required too much material and labour to be a primary control strategy.Budenberg et al. (1993) identified a male aggregation pheromone in banana weevil; sordidin, which has since been synthesized by Beauhaire et al. (1995) and Jayaraman et al. (1997). Pheromone traps can catch up to 25 times as many weevils per day as pseudostem traps and last for 1 month compared to 3-5 days for pseudostem traps. Such traps have been effective in reducing weevil populations in Costa Rica and the Canary Islands. In Costa Rica, normal recommendations are for 4 traps/ha, changed and moved every month. Unlike pseudostem traps, availability of materials is not a concern, although costs may be prohibitive for subsistence farmers. Crop residue breeding sites may serve as trap crops, drawing gravid females away from standing plants. Unfortunately, few data are available on the effects of crop sanitation on weevil population dynamics and related damage and yield loss. Mixed cropping systems often result in lower insect pressure by reducing immigration rates, interfering with host-plant location, and increasing emigration rates (lower tenure time). However, applicability of multiple cropping systems for the control of banana weevil may be limited. Banana weevils are sedentary insects that live in perennial systems in the presence of an abundant supply of hosts. Kehe (1985) has reported that plantain mixed with established coffee plants have lower weevil load than other systems. Uronu (1992) tested several banana intercrops and found that sweet potato reduced weevil load, perhaps only because this intercrop stunted banana growth.Integrated Pest ManagementSimon (1994) produced a bibliographical synthesis reviewing integrated control of C. sordidus.Regulatory Control  C. sordidus is spread from plantation to plantation, district to district and country to country, mainly by human agency, by the transport of infested parts of banana plants, especially the rhizomes. Strict phytosanitary quarantine measures are important to prevent the spread of this pest into countries where this pest is unknown.\", \"summaryOfInvasiveness\": \"\"}\n",
