Project Start Date: 1* October 1996 Project End Date: 1\" October 1999 1999 Horticultural Development Council 1 Crook Root Disease of Watercress Objectives and Background Crook root disease was first spotted in a watercress bed in Wiltshire in 1947. Since then, it has spread to all watercress growing areas in the U.K. Affected plants show characteristic crooked, swollen roots, the damage ofwhich results in yellowing of leaves, and a general loss of vigour. The disease tends to first appear as temperatures drop in October, and spreads from the bed outlet back towards the water source. Symptoms persist into the following April, and severe yield losses can occur. The organism responsible is a plasmodial organism, classified as Spongospora subterranea f. sp. nasturtii. It can survive for long periods, as tough resting spores in bed debris, until unknown environmental triggers cause it to germinate. Microscopic zoospores are then released, which initiate infection by swimming to host roots, and attaching. Once within the roots, the spores multiply, and release fresh zoospores into ) the water within seven days in ideal conditions. Levels of inoculum can thus increase very rapidly. In addition to causing crook root, Spongospora is also known to vector two damaging virus diseases ofwatercress (Watercress Yellow Spot, and Watercress Chlorotic Leaf Spot). Almost by chance, in the 1950 s, zinc was discovered to be able to control crookroot, and since then, it has been added to beds, often as zinc sulphate drip feed, over the winter months. However, total control is rarely achieved, and due to environmental concerns over its use, the levels that can be added to the water are tightly regulated (maximum levels of 0.075 ppm zinc at the outflow of beds).

Project Start Date: 1 October 1996 Project End Date: 1 October 1999 1999 Horticultural Development Council 1 Crook Root Disease of Watercress Objectives and Background Crook root disease was first spotted in a watercress bed in Wiltshire in 1947. Since then, it has spread to all watercress growing areas in the U.K. Affected plants show characteristic crooked, swollen roots, the damage ofwhich results in yellowing of leaves, and a general loss ofvigour. The disease tends to first appear as temperatures drop in October, and spreads from the bed outlet back towards the water source. Symptoms persist into the following April, and severe yield losses can occur. The organism responsible is a plasmodial organism, classified as Spongospora subterranea f. sp. nasturtii. It can survive for long periods, as tough resting spores in bed debris, until unknown environmental triggers cause it to germinate. Microscopic zoospores are then released, which initiate infection by swimming to host roots, and attaching. Once within the roots, the spores multiply, and release fresh zoospores into the water within seven days in ideal conditions. Levels of inoculum can thus increase very rapidly. In addition to causing crook root, Spongospora is also known to vector two damaging virus diseases ofwatercress (Watercress Yellow Spot, and Watercress Chlorotic Leaf Spot). Almost by chance, in the 1950 s, zinc was discovered to be able to control crookroot, and since then, it has been added to beds, often as zinc sulphate drip feed, over the winter months. However, total control is rarely achieved, and due to environmental concerns over its use, the levels that can be added to the water are tightly regulated (maximum levels of 0.075 ppm zinc at the outflow of beds). It is therefore desirable to both optimise the use of zinc, and to investigate other potential control measures. One aim of this project was to investigate how zoospores find watercress roots.

This practice, which has been adopted since the 1950's has been shown to give good control of crook root. - A high concentration of zinc is toxic to freshwater shrimps (Gammarus pulex) (Martin & Holdich 1986) and zinc emissions from watercress beds have been implicated in the reduction of numbers of these shrimps in rivers and streams downstream of watercress beds (Roddie, Kedwards & Crane 1992). Formerly crook root was controlled by the application of zinc to the spring water supplying watercress beds to give a concentration of 0.1 ppm in water flowing through the crop (Tomlinson 1960). Currently UK watercress producers are allowed to discharge zinc at only 0.075 ppm (0.075 mg/l). - - This project surveyed 12 watercress growing sites and sampled plants, which were scored for crook root disease, from all sites, in the hope of identifying the most effective zinc treatments and thereby optimising zinc applications for controlling crook root disease and minimising zinc discharges. The causal organism of crook root (Spongospora subterranea f. sp. nasturtii) infects watercress (Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum) roots, where it proliferates and causes the roots to become swollen and brittle and frequently curved in the shape of a crook (Tomlinson 1958). Roots are often stunted and tend to rot causing, in extreme cases, the plants to become dislodged. This is accompanied by a loss of vigour and a consequent reduction in yield. The disease is present in watercress roots all year round, but is particularly debilitating in winter when plants are growing slowly. organism infects watercress roots, where it proliferates and causes the roots to become swollen, brittle and frequently curved in the shape of a crook (Tomlinson 1958).

The crook root organism has the added importance of acting as the vector of watercress yellow spot virus (WYSV) which is another important disease affecting watercress production in the UK (Walsh, Clay & Miller 1989). The virus is also known to occur in France (Spire 1962). Like crook root, the virus is present in watercress roots all year round. At certain times of year (sometimes in winter, but mostly in spring) unknown factors induce the virus to move up into the leaves, where it causes the characteristic yellow spot symptoms. Plants with such symptoms are commercially unmarketable.\n",

      "Merged Content: EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Experimental site Small purpose-built experimental watercress beds measuring 2.3 x 20.1 m on a watercress farm in Dorset (National Grid reference SY 852936) (Doddings) where crook root and WYSV were known to occur (Walsh, Clay & Miller 1989) were selected for the evaluation, testing and screening of watercress lines, selections and hybrids. Some of these beds have been free of zinc treatments for many years and contain high levels of crook root and WYSV. Determination of susceptibility of plants to crook root and WYSV For determination of the susceptibility of different watercress lines and hybrids to crook root and WYSV, the module method (Walsh & Phelps 1991) developed at HRI was used. This involved raising watercress plants in small plastic modules (Plug tray P 576, Plantpak Ltd., UK) cut into arrays of 3 x 5 cells and containing autoclaved coarse sand irrigated with nutrient solution in the glasshouse for 4-6 weeks (depending on the time of year). These modules were placed in larger arrays of the same-sized modules to secure and space them. Following this propagation in the glasshouse, they were transported to the experimental site and placed in plastic crates (45 x 75 cm) with open sides and perforated bases, in the lower half of experimental watercress beds 4 or 5. The crates served to keep the modules clear of the bed base, allowing spring water to circulate freely under them, and prevented watercress growing in the bed from over-growing the modules and engulfing the test plants. The test plants remained in the bed for 6 weeks for infection to take place and were then returned to the laboratory for evaluation and testing. Plants were removed from the modules, sand washed from their roots and then visually assessed for the presence and severity of crook root. This was scored ona scale of 0-3 where 0 represents none; 1, few; 2, many and 3, abundant crooked roots visible. into the leaves where it causes the characteristic yellow spot symptoms. Plants with such symptoms are not marketable and therefore commercially unviable. A recent survey carried out by HRI in 1992 of the incidence of crook root and WYSV showed that the former was present at all watercress farm sites sampled and the latter at all but two sites. Of 203 individual watercress beds sampled at these different sites in Dorset, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Wiltshire, Yorkshire and Surrey, 183 (90%) contained plants infected by crook root and 152 (75%) contained plants infected by WYSV. Random sampling of the watercress beds showed that 58% of the plants were infected by crook root and 47% by WYSV. During the winter months when the effects of crook root on watercress are most severe, growers treat the water flowing through the watercress beds with zinc, mostly in the form of zinc solutions. This practice, which has been adopted since the 1950's has been shown to give good control of crook root. Recent research at Wellesbourne has shown that due to the vector relationship of crook root to WYSV, such treatments also give some control of WYSV. Formerly crook root was controlled by the application of zinc to the spring water supplying watercress beds to give a concentration of 0.1 ppm in water flowing through the crop (Tomlinson 1960).

Currently UK watercress producers are allowed to discharge zinc at only 0.075 ppm. This project aimed to investigate the potential of using natural plant resistance as an alternative to zinc for the control of crook root and to evaluate the commercial/agronomic acceptability of watercress accessions with improved levels of resistance to crook root and PRACTICAL SECTION FOR GROWERS Background Crook root disease of watercress (Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum) is caused by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. nasturtii.

      "Chunk Summary:  Crook root disease in watercress is primarily caused by the pathogen Spongospora subterranea, which is also known for causing powdery scab in potatoes. This disease is characterized by several distinct symptoms that affect the roots of the watercress plants. The most notable symptom is the formation of galls or swellings on the roots, which can lead to a 'crooked' appearance, hence the name 'Crook root.' These galls can disrupt the normal growth and function of the roots, leading to stunted plant growth and reduced yield. Infected plants may also exhibit yellowing of leaves and a general decline in vigor due to impaired nutrient and water uptake.\n",
